1. In the adminsitration panel, go to **Settings â†’ Upgrade Center**.

2. Check the values in the **FTP server options** section. The **Directory** input field should have the name of the directory on the server where CS-Cart is installed. For example, if CS-Cart is installed in the **store** directory, enter **/store** in that field.
