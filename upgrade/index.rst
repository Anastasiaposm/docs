Upgrade CS-Cart
***************

There are two ways to upgrade CS-Cart:

==============
Upgrade Center
============== 

Starting with CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor 4.0.x, you can use the **Upgrade Center** to upgrade your store to the latest version:

    :titlesonly:
    :glob:

    upgrade_process
    resolve_conflicts
    cscart_not_found

============
Store Import
============ 

You can use the **Store Import** add-on to upgrade your store from versions 2.2.4/2.2.5 or 3.0.x to CS-Cart or Multi-Vendor 4.3.x.
The upgrade is done by creating a separate CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor installation and using the add-on to import data from your old store.
