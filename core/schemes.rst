A scheme is a special file describing certain object structure. There are schemes for blocks, settings, promotions, etc. All schemes are stored in the *schemas* directory (*...app/schemas*). 

An add-on can extend and override a scheme fully or partially (:doc:`learn more <../addons/scheme_extending>`).
