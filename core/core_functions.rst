Core functions
**************

CS-Cart core functions are stored in the directory *core*. These functions implement all the core functionality of the software and are grouped into files according to their purpose or usage area: *fn.catalog.php*, *fn.cart.php*, etc.

:doc:`PHP hooks <../addons/hooking/php_hooks>` are used to extend and override the default behavior of the core functions. 

.. TODO Practical usage of hooks is explained in the Advanced CS-Cart Add-on tutorial.
