    **Tutorial Difficulty: 1 / 3**
    
    This functionality was not available before CS-Cart & Multi-Vendor 4.3.7.

If you go to **Orders → Shipments**, you will see all the list of all shipments in your store. Shipments have statuses, allowing you to sort the list, or to search for shipments with a specific status.

By default, there are 3 statuses: *Packed*, *Picked up*, and *Shipped*. However, you can edit them, or add your own statuses.

.. note::

    Shipment statuses do not affect anything—they only help you manage your list of shipments.
