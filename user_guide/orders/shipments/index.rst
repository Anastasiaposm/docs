Shipments
*********

In CS-Cart, shipments refer to situations when you ship items from a single order in multiple batches and/or at different periods of time. Such batches are treated as separate shipments of one order.

This functionality is very useful when you have to deal with back orders regularly.

For example, if a customer orders several items that are out-of-stock, you can ship in-stock items immediately after the order has been placed, and then send the rest of the order at a later day as a separate shipment.
