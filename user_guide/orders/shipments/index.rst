Shipments
*********

CS-Cart and Multi-Vendor allow you to ship items from a single order in multiple batches and/or at different periods of time. These batches are treated as separate **shipments** of one order. This is useful when you have to deal with back orders regularly.

For example, if a customer orders several items that are out of stock, you can ship the in-stock items once the order has been placed, and send the remaining items at a later date as a separate shipment.

=======================
How to Enable Shipments
=======================

Without shipments enabled, you can specify only one tracking number and shipping service per order.

To enable shipments, go to **Settings → General** and tick the **Allow multiple shipments for a single order** checkbox. Remember to save your changes with the **Save** button.

.. note::

    If you create shipments for some orders and later disable the **Allow multiple shipments for a single order** setting, you will be able to view and delete the created shipments, but you won't be able to create new shipments.

Once the checkbox is ticked, you will be able to :doc:`create shipments <create_shipment>` under **Orders → View orders → <Desired Order>**. You will also be able to view all the shipments under **Orders → Shipments**.
