You can copy orders, so that you don't have to enter customer's information or specify the products ordered again.

To copy an order, follow these steps:

1. In the Administration panel, go to **Orders → View orders**.

2. Click the **gear** button of the order you want to copy.

3. Choose **Copy**.
