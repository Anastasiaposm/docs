View Orders
***********

When you open the **Orders > View orders** section, the system automatically lists all orders from the database, i.e. the orders that have ever been placed and not deleted. By default, the list is arranged according to the date the orders were placed with the most recent orders at the top. If necessary, you can rearrange the list according to the order IDs or statuses, names or email addresses of users who placed the orders, or order totals.

To display the orders that satisfy a certain criterion or a combination of multiple criteria only, use the form to the right of the order list. By default, the form allows you to filter orders against names and e-mail addresses of users who placed the orders and the range of order totals. To access more filtering criteria, expand the form by clicking **Advanced search**.

If you filter orders against a particular search pattern regularly (e.g., to list all new orders that were paid with a gift certificate), you will find it convenient to save the pattern and add it to the list of pre-defined patterns appearing in the top left corner of the **View orders** section (see the picture below). For more information about using advanced search, please see the `Administration Panel Environment <http://www.cs-cart.com/documentation/reference_guide/index.htmld?home.htm>`_ section.
