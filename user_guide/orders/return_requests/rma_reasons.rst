RMA Reasons
***********

When submitting a return request, customers are asked to specify a reason why they want to return a particular product. The store administrator can adjust the default set of reasons by adding or removing reasons. It is also possible to activate or disable a certain reason from the list, which is useful when you need to temporarily deactivate the reason, but plan to use it again later.

To activate or disable a reason, click the *Active/Disabled* link, corresponding to the particular reason, and choose the required status from the drop-down menu.

You can also change the formulation of the reason and it's position on fly here.
