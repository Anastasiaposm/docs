RMA Actions
***********

RMA actions refer to the actions that a customer may expect to be taken towards his or her return requests: replace an item or make a refund. Customers are asked to choose a preferable action when they submit a return request. If a particular action is not applicable in your store, you can disable the action.

To activate or disable an action, click on the *Active/Disabled* field, corresponding to the particular action, and choose the required status from the drop-down menu.
