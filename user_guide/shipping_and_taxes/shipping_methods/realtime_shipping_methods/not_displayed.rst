Why the Realtime Shipping Method is Not Displayed
*************************************************

If the realtime shipping method is not displayed:

*   Go to **Administration → Shipping & Taxes → Shipping methods** and click on the name of the used shipping method.
*   Check whether the suitable carrier is chosen in the **Carrier** option.
*   Check whether the suitable shipping service is chosen in the **Shipping service** option.
*   Check whether the information was set up properly in the **Configure** tab.

.. note::

	Make sure that the **Test** mode check box is not selected. Realtime shipping services allow to execute only some special requests when the test mode is enabled.

*   Check whether weight of products to be shipped with the realtime shipping method is defined on product detailed pages:

    *   Go to **Products → Products**.
    *   Find products which will be shipped by this shipping method and click on its name.
    *   In the input field of the **Weight (lbs)** option should be a value (which is more than 0).

*   If you set up **USPS** shipping method, check that the user ID is confirmed. Call 800-344-7779 to confirm your ID.
