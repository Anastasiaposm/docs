Error When Clicking the Test Button
***********************************

*   The **Test** button works only for **real-time** shipping methods.
*   Make sure that the addresses are entered on the **Company** and **General** pages properly and they are different.
*   The address set up on the **Company** page (in the Administration panel, go to **Settings → Company**) is used as the address from which the products will be delivered. The address set up on the **General** page (in the Administration panel, go to **Settings → General**) is the address of delivery.

.. note::

	The **Default zip code** option on the **General** page should have only one zip code but not a range. The same is with the **Company zip code** option on the **Company** page.

*   Make sure that the selected service in the **Shipping service** option ships from the address set up on the **Company** page to the address set up on the **General** page.
*   Make sure that the weight entered in the **Weight (lbs)** input field next to the **Test** button is delivered by the service selected in the **Shipping service** option.
