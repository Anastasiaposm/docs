User Groups
***********

**User groups** can be regarded as different membership levels. You can use groups to control access to products and categories, as well as shipping and payment methods.

Groups also let you introduce multiple pricing schemes into the store. Administrator user groups allow you to set various restrictions for administrators—use that to create accounts with limited permissions for your staff.

The **User Groups** section under **Customers → User Groups** contains a list of user groups that exist in your store. 

===================
Adding a User Group
===================

* Click the **+** button. This will open a form with the group options.

* Fill in the form.

	* **User group**—name of the group.

	* **Type**—type of the group.

	* **Status**—initial status of the group.

* Click the **Create** button.

The new group will appear among the other user groups.

============================
Managing Membership Requests
============================

Customers can apply for a user group by clicking on the **Join** link on the storefront (**Profile details →  User groups** tab). The store administrator can either approve or decline the request.

    You must log in as the root administrator to do this.

To process a request, complete the following steps:

* Go to **Customers → User Groups**.

* Click on the **gear** button and choose the **User group requests** tab to open a list of pending requests.

Configuring Administrator Permissions
=====================================

For each user group of the administrator type you can specify what the administrators from that group can or cannot do:

* Click the **gear** button corresponding to the required administrator group in the list and choose **Edit**, open the **Privileges** tab. This will open a list of administrator tasks.
