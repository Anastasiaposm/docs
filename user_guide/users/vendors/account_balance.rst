    **Vendors** are available only in **Multi-Vendor**.

The root administrator can review the income and expenditure statistics (total, per vendor, per period) and register payouts to vendors under **Vendors → Account balance**.

The section contains the sorted list of all vendors, incomes, and payouts. To filter the list, use the search form to the right of the list. To make the search results more precise, use the **Advanced search** option.

Every entry on the list has the following attributes:

* **Vendor**—name of the vendor.

* **Sales period**—period for which the income was earned or the expenditure was made.

* **Payment amount**—the amount paid.

* **Date**—date when the order was placed.

* **Vendor commission**—the amount of money subtracted from the vendor's income towards your commission for selling this vendor's products in your store. The size of the commission is defined on the vendor's profile page.

* **Payment**—the payment method through which the vendor received the payment. If the entry represents the store income, you will see the ID of the customer order containing the vendor products.

* **Comments**—administrator's comments on the payout; click the **expand button** (grey arrow) to see the comments.

Below the list you can see the detailed accounting information:

* **Balance carried forward**—the amount that the vendor(s) have been previously under- or overpaid.

* **Sales period total**—the cost of all vendor products bought over the given period.

* **Total sales period payout**—the amount already paid to the vendor(s).

* **Total amount due**—the amount to be paid to the vendor(s) in the given period.
