*********************************

    **Vendors** are available only in **Multi-Vendor**.

To merge two vendor accounts, comlete the following steps:

1. Open Multi-Vendor administration panel.

2. Go to **Vendors â†’ Vendors**.

3. Press the **gear button** of the vendor account that you want to merge into another vendor account.

4. Select the **Merge** action.

.. warning::
    Please double-check which account you are handling at this step, because it is the account that will be removed from database in the end.

5. Select the vendor account that will inherit all data associated from the account that is being disposed of.

6. Click **Merge**.
