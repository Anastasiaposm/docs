Issues with Logging in to the Administration Panel
**************************************************

There are several possible solutions for the problem with logging in.

1. Make sure that you enter the correct email and password. Use the email address you entered when you installed CS-Cart.

2. Clear the browser cache.

.. hint::

   Different browsers have different methods of clearing cache, but the standard key combination to do it is **Ctrl+R**.

3. Clear the template cache: delete the ``var/cache`` directory of your store. For remote servers, use an FTP client, SSH client or the file manager of your web hosting control panel to do it.

.. hint::

    If you can access your the administration panel of your store, you can clear the cache here: **Administration → Storage → Clear cache**.

If you still can't access the panel, submit a ticket in our `Customer Help Desk <https://www.cs-cart.com/helpdesk>`_ and provide us with a temporary FTP access to your server.

.. hint::

    If you can't remember your password to the administration panel, use the **Forgot your password?** link.
