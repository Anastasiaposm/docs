Issues with Logging in to the Administration Panel
**************************************************

There are several possible solutions for the problem with logging in.

1. Make sure that you enter the correct email and password. Use the email address you entered when you installed CS-Cart.

2. Clear the browser cache.

.. hint::

   Different browsers have different methods of clearing cache, but the standard key combination to do it is **Ctrl+R**.

3. Clear the template cache. To clear the cache in the administration panel, go to **Administration → Storage → Clear cache**. The cache files are located in the ``var/cache`` directory of your store.

If you still can't access the panel, submit a ticket in our `Customer Help Desk <https://www.cs-cart.com/helpdesk>`_ and provide us with a temporary FTP access to your server.

.. hint::

    If you can't remember your password to the administration panel, use the **Forgot your password?** link.
