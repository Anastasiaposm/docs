Product Option Combinations
***************************

To make inventory tracking easier, you can group different combinations of :doc:`product option variants <product_options>` under **option combinations**. For example, clothes come in various colors and sizes. Option combinations allow you to track separately, how many blue XL T-shirts and white M T-shirts you have. 

.. note::

   Only *Checkbox*, *Select box*, and *Radiogroup* options can be a part of a combination. An option must also have the **Inventory** checkbox ticked, or it won't appear among the options of the combination.
