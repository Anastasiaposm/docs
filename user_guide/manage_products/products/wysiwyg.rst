***************************************************************************
Content From the WYSIWYG Editor Is Not Displayed Properly on the Storefront
***************************************************************************

If the content you entered in the `WYSIWYG <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG>`_ editor is not desplated properly on the storefront, make sure that the HTML content is not copied and pasted from another text editor (e.g. **Microsoft Word**). 

Microsoft Word tends to insert hidden code into a text which, when pasted into a web page using the **WYSIWYG** editor, can mess up the layout and cause internet browsers, such as Internet Explorer, to crash and/or display an error.

To avoid it, create the necessary content directly in the WYSIWYG editor that is integrated in the default CS-Cart installation.

.. note::

    If you have a lot of text content written in **Microsoft Word**, copy the content and paste it into **Notepad**: that will remove all the unwanted code from the text. Then you can copy the text from **Notepad** and paste it into the **WYSIWYG editor**. This will provide a clean copy of the text that can be formatted properly within CS-Cart.
