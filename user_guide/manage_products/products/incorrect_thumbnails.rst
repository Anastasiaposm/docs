Incorrect Thumbnails on the Storefront
**************************************

If you uploaded a new detailed image for a product, and the thumbnail of the product on the storefront hasn't changed or doesn't show up at all, it may be due to the fact that the new thumbnail has not been generated automatically after you uploaded the new image.

To delete the generated thumbnails and create new ones automatically, go to **Administration → Storage → Clean up generated thumbnails**.
