**************************************
Incorrect Thumbnails on the Storefront
**************************************

If you uploaded a new detailed image for a product, and the thumbnail of the product on the storefront hasn't changed or doesn't show up at all, it may be due to the fact that the automatically created thumbnails have not been generated after you uploaded the new image.

To re-generate the automatically created thumbnails, clear the thumbnail cache: in the administration panel go to **Administration â†’ Storage** and choose the **Clean up generated thumbnails** action.
