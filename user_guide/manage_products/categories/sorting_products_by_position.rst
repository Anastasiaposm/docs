	The defined positions affect sorting only if the **Sort by Position: Low To High** or **Sort by Position: High To Low** sorting is selected on the product list page in the storefront.

	If you wish the **Sort by Position: Low To High** or **Sort by Position: High To Low** sorting to be the default sorting, when a visitor opens a category page, select the necessary variant in the **Product list default sorting** select box on the **Settings > Appearance** page. Make sure that these sortings are selected in the **Available product list sortings** section as well.
