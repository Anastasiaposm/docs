Use this section to add and manage extra product fields. Later, these features may be used to supplement standard product information. For example, it can be a field for ISBN, if you sell printed books, a field for audio formats, if you sell music, etc.

The section contains a list of all product features that are available in your store. Optionally, you can arrange features into groups and then edit the settings of the whole group instead of editing every single feature.
