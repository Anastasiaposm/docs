Types of Promotions
===================

CS-Cart supports two types of promotions. Their main difference is the type of the bonus you can set.

* **Catalog promotions** allow you to set discounts on products and categories, and to specify conditions for those discounts.

* **Cart promotions** also allow you to set discounts on products and orders. Other possible bonuses include discount coupons, free shipping, free products, reward points, membership in a specific user group, etc. The list of possible conditions for those bonuses is also bigger.

.. important::

    **Cart promotions** are not available in the Free mode.
