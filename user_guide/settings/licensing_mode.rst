**************

In this section you can choose one of three licensing modes: *Full*, *Trial* or *Free*.

.. important::
    **Multi-Vendor** does not have the *Free* mode, but only *Full* or *Trial*.

In the **Full mode** you get unrestricted access to the full functionality of CS-Cart or Multi-Vendor. To enable this mode you must enter the licence number.

You get this number when you buy a full version of CS-Cart or Multi-Vendor `at the official website <http://www.cs-cart.com/compare.html>`_. You will be able switch to the **Full mode** any time by entering a valid license number on the **Licensing mode** page.

In the **Trial mode** there are no functionality limitations. You can `download CS-Cart and Multi-Vendor at official site <https://www.cs-cart.com/download-cs-cart.html>`_ and use the **Trial mode** for free. However, you can use it only once and only for 30 days.

The **Free mode** will be activated automatically in 30 days, unless you activate the **Full mode**.

The **Free mode** allows you to run the store free of charge with no time restrictions. This mode offers a basic set of eCommerce tools. The **Free mode** is essentially a free version of CS-Cart, with some functionality and add-ons unavailable. You will be able to switch to the **Full mode** any time by entering a valid license number on the **Licensing mode** page.
