.. important::
    **Vendors** are only available in **Multi-Vendor**.

Use this section to adjust vendor settings for the administration panel and the storefront.

* **Display product vendor**—if you enable this setting, the name of the product vendor will appear next to the product description.

* **Allow users to apply for vendor account**—if you enable this setting, the **Apply for a vendor account** link will appear in the **My Account** block on the storefront. Using this link, customers will be able to send the root administrator a request for registration as a store vendor. It is not necessary to review the section with a list of vendor accounts regularly, since the root administrator receives a pop-up notification of pending vendor accounts when signing in to the administration panel.

* **Automatically create the administrator account for the new approved vendor. (If the "Allow users to apply for vendor account" setting is enabled)**—if you enable this setting, the company administrator will be automatically created together with the company.

* **Vendors per page**—the number of vendors displayed on one page.

* **Include shipping cost in vendor commission**—if you enable this setting, the cost of shipping the order is considered at vendor commission calculation.

* **Take payment surcharge from vendors**—if you enable this setting, vendors will get entrusted to pay payment surcharges (see :doc:`this article <../payment_methods/configure_payment>` for details).
