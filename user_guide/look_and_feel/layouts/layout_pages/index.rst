Layout Pages
************

A layout page can represent either a certain type of the storefront pages (for example, detailed product pages, category pages, etc.) or a specific storefront page (for example, checkout page, cart page, etc.)

By changing the layout of a specific layout page, you automatically change all storefront pages that this layout page represents.

Although a layout page cannot represent a specific page that belongs to a particular page type, you can configure individual blocks to appear on specific pages only. This feature makes it possible to create a unique look and feel for individual storefront pages. For more details, please refer to `Design > Layouts > Blocks <http://www.cs-cart.com/documentation/reference_guide/index.htmld?design_block_manager_blocks.htm>`_.

.. note::

	To associate a layout page with a specific page or page type, use the **Dispatch** option on the layout page attributes form (the gear icon near the layout page name).

Default layout page
*******************

A storefront must have a default layout page assigned. This property is assigned to a layout page by selecting the **Default** check box on the layout page attributes form.

The default layout page defines the storefront top panel, header, and footer that are inherited by the other pages. Also, the layout of the default layout page is used by the storefront pages that do not have a separate layout page defined.

The layout page with the default property cannot be removed until you re-assign a new default layout page.
