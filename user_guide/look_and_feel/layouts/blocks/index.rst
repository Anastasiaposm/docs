Blocks
******

While containers form the storefront structure, blocks basically populate this structure with contents and function elements. It is convenient to regard blocks as separate boxes which represent a particular storefront component. This can be a search form, currency or language selector, top menu, product filter, banner, list of products, text, HTML insertion, etc. Just everything what can appear on the storefront is created by using blocks.

Blocks differ from each other in the type of data they represent. However, blocks with the same data type can have different filling, appearance, and configuration. Moreover, certain blocks may be assigned to specific items/pages only. This makes blocks a highly powerful and flexible tool for building custom storefronts and creating individual pages out of a typical framework.

CS-Cart already offers a number of pre-defined blocks. Use them to quickly add the most popular and common storefront components. In addition, you can create custom blocks based on the available templates.
