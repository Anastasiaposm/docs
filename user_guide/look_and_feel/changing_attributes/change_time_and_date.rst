************************************************************

===================
General Information
===================

A time zone is a standard of time for a specific region on the globe. The standard is used for legal, commercial, and social purposes. In CS-Cart a time zone helps customers to navigate through a store and to follow special events like sales, giveaways, etc.

A datetime panel tracks time and date of events in a store. It is used in many different places, for example: 

* It tracks the time the order was placed.

    :alt: Date and time on the orders page

* It tracks the time the product review was added.
