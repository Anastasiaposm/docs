A time zone is a standard of time for a specific region on the globe. The standard is used for legal, commercial, and social purposes. Setting a proper time zone for your store can help your customers keep track of special events like sales, giveaways, etc.

A datetime panel shows time and date of events in the store. It is used in many different places, for example:
