How To: Close Your Storefront
*****************************

There are times when you don't want anyone to access your store: for example, you're working on some changes and don't want the customers or search engines to see the work in progress.

To close the storefront, complete the following steps:

* In the Administration panel, go to **Settings → General**.

* Tick the **Close storefront** checkbox.

* Fill in in the **Access key to temporarily closed store** field.

.. note::

    You can use the access key to view the closed storefront. If your site is available at *http://example.com* and you entered *secret* in the **Access key to temporarily closed store** field, you will be able to access the closed storefront by the following URL: *http://www.example.com/index.php?store_access_key=secret*
