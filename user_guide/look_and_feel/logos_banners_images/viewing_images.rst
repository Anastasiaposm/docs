*   In the **General** tab next to the image of the product click the **upload them manually** link.

	After changing these settings you will need to clean up the thumbnail cache in order to re-generate the automatically created thumbnails. To do it, go to **Administration → Storage → Clean up generated thumbnails**.

.. note ::

    Detailed pictures are displayed in the viewing larger image window, created thumbnails are displayed on the product details page. If you add additional images for the product, additional small thumbnails are created and displayed under the main image on the product details page.
