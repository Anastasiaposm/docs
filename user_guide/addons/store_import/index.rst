Store Import
************

You can use the **Store Import** add-on to upgrade your store from versions 2.2.4/2.2.5 or 3.0.x to CS-Cart or Multi-Vendor 4.x.x.
The upgrade is done by creating a separate CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor 4.x.x installation and using the add-on to import data from your old store.

.. important::

    The **Store Import** add-on is **not available since CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor 4.3.3**. It was **re-introduced in CS-Cart 4.3.6**, but not in Multi-Vendor.
