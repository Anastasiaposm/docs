Store Import
************

You can use the **Store Import** add-on to upgrade your store from versions 2.2.4/2.2.5 or 3.0.x to CS-Cart or Multi-Vendor 4.x.x.
The upgrade is done by creating a separate CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor 4.x.x installation and using the add-on to import data from your old store.

.. important::

    The **Store Import** add-on is **not available since CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor 4.3.3**. It was **re-introduced in CS-Cart 4.3.6**, but not in Multi-Vendor.

    **Starting from CS-Cart 4.3.7, the Store Import add-on doesn't come with the CS-Cart installation package**. We moved this add-on to the CS-Cart Marketplace. `Download <http://marketplace.cs-cart.com/add-ons/store-import.html>`_ and install it manually. For CS-Cart 4.3.6 we also recommend that you use the Store Import add-on from the Marketplace, because it has all the latest fixes. In this case, uninstall the Store Import add-on you have in your CS-Cart 4.3.6 before installing the one you got on the Marketplace.
