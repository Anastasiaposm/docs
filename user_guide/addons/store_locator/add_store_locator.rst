The created block will be displayed on the storefront. If a customer enters the store name, city or country in the input field in this block and clicks the **Search** button, he/she will see your store location closest to him on the map.

.. note::

	After the block is created or changed, make sure it is displayed correctly. Sometimes not all wrappers are suitable for the blocks.
