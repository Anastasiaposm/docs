    A pop-up window will appear. Click **Unselect all**, then tick **eBay template** and click **Modify selected**. Specify the appropriate eBay templates for the products and click **Save**.  

*  Tick the **Redefine price on eBay** checkbox, if you want your product to have a different price on eBay

*  Select the **eBay package type**

*  Tick the **Redefinition of the product name and description on eBay** and edit the corresponding fields, if you want the product’s name and description to be different on eBay.
