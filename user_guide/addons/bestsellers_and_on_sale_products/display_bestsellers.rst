Products Selected for the Bestsellers List
******************************************

Products in the **Bestsellers** block are shown according to sales statistics. The **Bestsellers** side box is displayed if there are orders in your store that have *Completed* or *Processed* statuses.

On the home page CS-Cart displays a list of all bestsellers. When a visitor enters a category, the **Bestsellers** section shows best selling products according to sales statistics for this particular category.
If there are no bought products in this category, the **Bestsellers** side box disappears.
