How To: Add the Bestsellers, On sale, Final sale, and Newest Products Pages to the Storefront
*********************************************************************************************

The **Bestsellers**, **On sale**, **Final sale**, and **Newest** products pages are added to the storefront using following URLs:

*   **Bestsellers** - *products.bestsellers*
*   **On sale** - *products.on_sale*
*   **Final sale** - *products.final_sale*
*   **Newest** - *products.newest*

	:align: center
	:alt: Final sale, storefront

Only thing you have to do, is to give customers access to these pages from some part of the storefront, for example, using menu:

*   In the Administration panel, go to the **Design → Menus** section.
*   Click the **+** button in the top right corner of the page.
*   Fill in the **Name** field and click **Create**.
*   In the **Items for menu** section click the **+** button to add menu items.
*   Fill in the **Name** field. In the **URL** field, write the desired URL as described above: *products.bestsellers*, *products.on_sale*, *products.final_sale*, or *products.newest*.
*   Click the **Create** button.

Now customers will be able to access the **Final sale** page (in this example) by clicking the menu on the storefront.

Another way to access these pages is using banners:

Create a banner:

*   Go to **Marketing → Banners**.
*   Click the **+** button in the top right corner of the page.
*   In the **Type** select box choose *Graphic banner*.
*   Fill in the **Name** field. In the **Image** field upload an image for your graphic banner.
*   In the **URL** field, write the desired URL as described above: *products.bestsellers*, *products.on_sale*, *products.final_sale*, or *products.newest*)
*   Click the **Create and close** button.

Add the banner to the storefront

*   Go to **Design → Layouts** and switch to the layout page where you want the banner to appear.
*   Choose the desired container, click the **+** icon on it, and click **Add block**.
*   In the opened window switch to the **Create New Block** tab and click the **Banners** button.
*   Fill in the **Name** field and switch to the **Content** tab.
*   In this tab pick *Manual* in the **Filling** select box, and click the **Add banners** button.
*   Here you can see the list of banners in your store. Pick the banner you have just created and click **Add banners and close**.
*   Click the **Create** button.

Now customers will be able to access the page by clicking the banner on the storefront.
