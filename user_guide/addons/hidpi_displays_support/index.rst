HiDPI displays support
**********************

This add-on enables the high-resolution (Retina) displays support. HiDPI (dots per inch) are displays with significantly more pixels per inch than in ordinary displays.

For example, the Retina displays found on the iPhone, iPad, and MacBook are HiDPI.

.. note ::

	All newly uploaded images will be automatically shrinked (twice) to improve loading time on non-HiDPI devices. Existing images are not changed. It is recommended to upload high-definition images.
