Actions on Gift Certificates
****************************

Adding a gift certificate
*************************

Although gift certificates are supposed to be created by customers, store administrators are also allowed to create and modify gift certificates in the administration panel.

To add a certificate:

*	Go to the **Marketing > Gift certificates** section.

Here is a list of all gift certificates that have been created in the store (both by customers and store administrators) and haven't been deleted.

*	Click the **+** button.

This will open a form for creating a gift certificate, which is quite similar to the form that customers use to create gift certificates.

*	Complete the form:

	*	**To** - Name of the person who the certificate will be sent to.
	*	**From** - Name of the person who sends the certificate.
	*	**Message** - Cover message for the certificate (greeting, some wish, etc.)
	*	**Amount** - Certificate worth. Can be either specified as a custom amount or chosen from a fixed set of available amounts.

	.. note ::

		The amount must lie within the minimum and maximum amounts that are defined by the :doc:`settings <../gift_certificates/gc_addon_settings>` of the **Gift certificates** add-on.

	*	**Send via email/Send via postal mail** - Choose to send the certificate via email or regular post and specify either an email or a regular address.
	*	**Free products** - Products that will be bundled with the certificate and sent to the recipient. Click the **Add Product** button to bundle new products.
	*	**Notify customer** - If selected, the customer receives an automatic email notification when a new gift certificate is created.
	
*	Click the Create button.

Editing gift certificates
*************************

Store administrators are allowed to edit details of existing gift certificates.

To edit a gift certificate:

*	Go to the **Marketing > Gift certificates** section.
*	Click on the code of the certificate you want to edit. This will open a form that is pretty the same as the one you use to create certificates.
*	Edit the fields in the form.
*	Click the **Save** button.

Viewing gift certificate history
********************************

CS-Cart registers all changes in the balance of a gift certificate.

To view the history of changes:

*	Display the list of certificates in the **Marketing > Gift certificates** section.
*	Click on the code of the certificate which history of changes you want to view. This will open the page with gift certificate details.
*	Switch to the **History** tab to open a tab with a list of changes. Each entry in the list contains the following elements:

	*	**Date** – Date and time the change was made.
	*	**Email** – Email address of the user who changed the balance.
	*	**Order ID** – ID of the order.
	*	**Name** – Name of the user who changed the balance.
	*	**Balance** – Certificate worth before the balance was changed.
	*	**Debit balance** – Certificate worth after the balance was changed.
