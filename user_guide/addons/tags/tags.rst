Managing Tags
*************

.. important::

    Install and enable the **Tags** add-on to be able to create and manage tags.

Use the **Website → Tags** section to manage the tags of different pages of your store. Tags can be considered as free-form keywords or labels associated with a page or product. Tags make it easier to find the necessary page/product.

.. note:: 

    Tags are managed separately for every storefront.

Tags created by the store administrators appear on the storefront in the **Tag cloud** side box. Use the settings under **Design → Layouts** to :doc:`display the Tag Cloud side box on the storefront <tag_cloud>`.

==============
Tag Attributes
==============

* **Tag**—the name of the tag as it appears on the storefront.

* **Products**—the number of products to which the tag is assigned.

* **Pages**—the number of pages to which the tag is assigned.

.. hint::

    If you click on those numbers, you'll get the lists of products and pages with this specific tag.

.. important::

    The **Products** and **Pages** columns only appear if you enable **Tags for products** and **Tags for pages** under **Add-ons → Manage add-ons → Tags**.

* **Status**—the status of the tag: 

  * *approved*

  * *disapproved*

  * *pending* 

.. note::

    Tags added by the administrator automatically get the **Approved** status.

To delete a tag click the **gear button** of the particular tag and choose **Delete**. The drop-down list to the right allows you to change the tag status.

If you want to approve, disapprove, or delete several tags at a time, tick the checkboxes of the tags and press the **gear button** in the top right corner of the page. Then choose the desired action from the drop-down list.
