The Reward Points Add-on Settings
*********************************

To manage the following settings, go to **Add-ons > Manage add-ons** and click on the name of the **Reward Points** add-on.

*	**Points Exchange Rate (PER)** - Global exchange rate to convert monetary product costs to points. The value you enter here is the number of points to cover one monetary unit (e.g., $1, €1 or £1), which is the default store currency.

.. note ::

	For example, with the exchange rate of 10 points and the product cost of $50, the product worth in points is 500 points (50*10).
	
*	**''Price in points'' is calculated automatically on PER basis** - If selected, products' worth in points is calculated automatically based on the global exchange rate.
*	**''Price in points'' is recalculated taking into account discounts** - If selected, products' worth is recalculated after discounts are applied.
*	**''Points'' is recalculated taking into account discounts** - If selected, points are recalculated after discounts are applied.
*	**''Price in points'' is recalculated taking into account order discounts** - If selected, products' worth is recalculated after order discounts are applied.
*	**''Points'' is recalculated taking into account order discounts** - If selected, points are recalculated after order discounts are applied.
*	**If the product and the product category do not have defined reward points but the higher level category has such reward points, extract data from it** - If selected, categories and products with no bundled points inherit the amount of reward points from a higher level category.
*	**If several reward points can be applied, set** - The rule to handle multiple bonuses. Select whether to give a minimum or maximum bonus when multiple bonuses can be applied.
*	**Apply zero reward point values** - If selected, members of a user group for which zero reward points are defined will not get reward points. Otherwise, one of the other rules will apply to this user group, and its members will receive reward points according to the rule.
*	**Log lines per page** - Number of records from the log to be displayed on a single Reward points log page.
