How To: Add Reward Points for Order Automatically
*************************************************

*	In the Administration panel, go to **Add-ons → Manage add-ons** and :doc:`enable the Reward points add-on <../reward_points/set_rp_addon>`.
*	Go to **Marketing → Reward points**.
*	Select the user group, who will receive the points, and in the **Amount** field next to the user group enter the number of reward points and select the amount type next to it.

	If *Percent (%)* is selected in the **Amount type** option, the number of points received by a customer is calculated depending on the product prices (not on the total order cost). If *Absolute (points)* is selected in the **Amount type** option, the specified number of points will be added to a customer account regardless the purchased products cost.
