RSS Feed
********

With this add-on, you add an RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feed generator to your store. This means that store visitors can subscribe to receive updates on the activity in your store in a friendly and habitual manner together with other news and notifications they daily receive.

To enable visitors to subscribe to an RSS feed, you need to add an RSS icon on the storefront. To add the icon and configure the RSS feed properties, use a block of the **RSS** feed type in the **Design > Layouts** section.
