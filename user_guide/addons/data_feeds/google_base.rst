The `Google export <http://www.cs-cart.com/documentation/reference_guide/index.htmld?administration_addons_google_export.htm>`_ add-on adds a pre-defined data feed template to the store. This template basically links CS-Cart product fields with those required by Google. You can customize the mapping rules by linking more fields or removing the existing fields.

This pre-defined template is suitable for regular products from a US supplier. If your products require more fields or you are from a different country, you need to create a new template.

A complete specification of product fields supported by Google is available `here <http://support.google.com/merchants/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=188494>`_.

If some necessary product fields are missing in CS-Cart, add them as product features. See the `Features <http://docs.cs-cart.com/4.3.x/user_guide/manage_products/features/index.html>`_ section for more details.
