The **Anti fraud** add-on is an integrated fraud screening facility supported by the `MaxMind minFraud <https://www.maxmind.com/en/purchase-minfraud-services>`_ service. It offers advanced protection from fraudulent credit card transactions by estimating the risk factor according to multiple parameters, which include matching of the user's IP-address and user entered data, historic legitimate and suspicious activity, etc.

Since the add-on relies on the `MaxMind minFraud <https://www.maxmind.com/en/purchase-minfraud-services>`_ service, to start screening orders for frauds you need to have a valid account with MaxMind and subscribe to one of their fraud detection services.
