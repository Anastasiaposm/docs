.. note ::

	This add-on requires that the `Data feeds <http://docs.cs-cart.com/4.3.x/user_guide/addons/data_feeds/index.html>`_ add-on has been installed and activated first.

With this add-on you can export products to `Google Shopping <https://www.google.com/intl/en_/ads/shopping/index.html>`_. In a nutshell, the **Google Export** add-on introduces the following changes to CS-Cart:

*	Adds a data feed template to the **Add-ons > Data feeds** section for creating and exporting data feeds to Google Shopping on a regular basis. See more information about this template `here <http://www.cs-cart.com/documentation/reference_guide/index.htmld?data_feed_google.htm>`_.

*	Adds extra product fields required by Google as product features. See the `Features <http://docs.cs-cart.com/4.3.x/user_guide/manage_products/features/index.html>`_ section.
