SEO is a common acronym for *Search Engine Optimization*. Obviously, the add-on aims at helping you optimize your web store for search engines and improve its ranking.

Optimization consists in replacing unattractive dynamic URLs like *http://www.example.com/index.php?dispatch=products.view&product_id=1533* containing query strings and ancillary data

with clean search engine friendly URLs like *http://www.example.com/true_product_name.html*.

Such URLs not only help search engines to index store pages, but they also improve your customers' experience, as clean URLs are human-readable and thus are easy to perceive and remember.

.. important ::

	The add-on requires that your web server have a URL rewriter installed. For the Apache HTTP Server or any Apache interchangeable implementation it must be the *mod_rewrite* module. For Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) it must be *ISAPI_Rewrite*.
