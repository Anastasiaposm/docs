SEO Add-on Functionality
************************

The aim of the SEO add-on is to make the site more friendly for search engines.

For example, a category page will have the URL: `http://demo.cs-cart.com/sports-and-outdoors/bikes/ <http://demo.cs-cart.com/sports-and-outdoors/bikes/>`_ instead of: `http://demo.cs-cart.com/index.php?dispatch=categories.view&category_id=204 <http://demo.cs-cart.com/index.php?dispatch=categories.view&category_id=204>`_

To enable the **SEO** add-on:

*	In the Administration panel, go to **Add-ons â†’ Manage add-ons**.
*	Enable the **SEO** add-on (change its status to *Active*).
*	Click on the name of the add-on and specify the settings in the opened window:

	*	**Product SEO URL format** - Pattern for clean URLs for storefront product pages.
	*	**Category SEO URL format** - Pattern for clean URLs for storefront category pages.
	*	**Page SEO URL format** - Pattern for clean URLs for other store pages.
	*	**Other SEO URL format** - Pattern for clean URLs for other items.
	*	**Show language in the URL** - If selected, URLs include the code of the language in which the referred page is displayed. The code follows the host name and the directory name.
	*	**Use single URL for all languages** - If selected, the same URL is used to address a page disregarding the current page language. Otherwise, the page is referred to by several separate URLs according to the languages that the page can appear in.
	*	**Allow non-latin symbols in URL**- If selected, URLs can contain symbols from different languages.
