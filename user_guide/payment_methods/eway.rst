    *   **Client ID** — enter the eWAY ID number.
    *   **Order prefix** — any prefix you want invoice IDs to have on eWAY site (optional field) (for instance, *mycart*). Using the prefix allows to prevent duplicate invoice IDs in case you use the same eWAY account for accepting payment from several websites;
