*********************************************

You might see the following message when you open your store in Internet Explorer:

.. note::

    This page contents both secure and nonsecure items.
    Do you want to display the nonsecure items?

This message appears because the page is accessing resources from non-SSL sites or locations.

It can happen if you use commercial ads (images, flash animations), or a Javascript code from non-secure servers (traffic ranking, Google Analytics, etc)

To prevent this message from appearing, remove or change the code that causes the problem.
