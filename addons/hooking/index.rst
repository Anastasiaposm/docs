Hooking
*******

Hooking is a concept in programming that deals with control flow. A hook is just a special place in the source code which serves as an entry point for some external code.

Thanks to this technique, you can create an add-on and hook it to the necessary part of code. As a result, your add-on will work without affecting the core functionality. 

.. A great practical example of hook usage is provided in the :doc:`Advanced Add-on Tutorial <>`. (add a link)

CS-Cart uses two kinds of hooksâ€”in the source code (PHP hooks) and in the templates (TPL hooks). In this section you can find both hook types explained.

`Here <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking>`_ you can read some general information on hooking.
