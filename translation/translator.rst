CS-Cart Translator Quick Guide
******************************

`CS-Cart Translator <http://translate.cs-cart.com/>`_ is a web service that is used to collaboratively translate the CS-Cart and Multi-Vendor software.

It is based on the WordPress's `GlopPress <http://en.support.wordpress.com/glotpress/>`_.

Here is a quick guide that will help you get started.

Get Started
===========

Go to the `CS-Cart Translator <http://translate.cs-cart.com/>`_ website and log in using your `CS-Cart community forums <http://forum.cs-cart.com/>`_ username and password (the **Log in** link in the upper right corner of the page). If you don't have an account yet, just `create a new one <http://forum.cs-cart.com/index.php?app=core&module=global&section=register>`_—it's free.

On this page, all the released and scheduled CS-Cart versions are listed. The released versions are separated from the scheduled ones by a horizontal line.

Select the nearest scheduled version:

On this page, you see all currently available languages. Choose the one you want to contribute to. For example, **Italian**.

.. note::

    On the left, you can see another **Sub-projects** box, with **Multi-Vendor** in it. If you want to contribute to the Multi-Vendor translation, switch to this sub-project. The rest of the workflow is identical.

Add/Edit a Suggestion
=====================

Here, you can see all present language variable translations. Note the legend at the bottom of the table explaining the color codes in use.

*   **Language variable**—unique language variable name and it's context to make it simplier to locate an entry in the CS-Cart or Multi-Vendor storefront or admin panels

*   **Original string**—original English text

*   **Translation**—string translation to the selected language. This is the only column you will be editing

Double-click on any item or click **Details** to edit it:

In the text area, enter your translation variant and click the **Suggest new translation** button.

And that's it! The suggestion will be submitted and, if approved by a validator, will be included in the next CS-Cart & Multi-Vendor version.

Suggestion Approval
===================

A validator will review your suggestion, then approve, edit, or reject it. When a new CS-Cart & Multi-Vendor release is built, all approved suggestions by that point are included in the distribution package. You can download the approved translations using the **Export** button at the lower left corner of the page (you should first switch to the language you want to download the translation for).
