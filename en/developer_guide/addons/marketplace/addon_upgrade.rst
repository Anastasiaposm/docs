************************************************
Distributing Add-on Upgrades via the Marketplace
************************************************

An upgrade package is an archive that contains all the files necessary to upgrade a customer’s add-on automatically. Normally this archive includes:

* Files that were changed or added in the new version.

* Files with the new language variables.

* Validators that check conditions before installing the upgrade.

* Migrations that change the structure and data of the database.

Upgrade packages can be installed in the Upgrade Center in one of the ways:

* Specify the location of the upgrade package on a local machine or via a URL.

* Retrieve the packages from the upgrade server with the Upgrade Center.

This article tells how add-on developers can create upgrade packages for their add-ons.

Build an Add-on Upgrade Package
===============================

----------------------------------------
Way 1. Build an Upgrade Package Manually
----------------------------------------

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Step 1. Create the Upgrade Package
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Create an upgrade package as described :doc:`in this article </upgrade/upgrade_addon>`. Most importantly, please follow the :ref:`recommended structure of an add-on <addon-upgrade-package-structure>`.

Starting with version 4.4.1, CS-Cart has a built-in Marketplace connector, so you don't need to create your own upgrade connector and add it your add-on.

.. important::

    If you need the Marketplace connector code for some reason, we described it in `an earlier version of this article (version 4.3.x) <https://docs.cs-cart.com/4.3.x/developer_guide/addons/marketplace/addon_upgrade.html#step-1-create-the-upgrade-package>`_.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Step 2. Upload the Package to the Marketplace
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

#. Open the add-on editing page on the Marketplace.

#. Go to the **Product packages** tab.

#. Click **Upload upgrade**.

#. Use the **File** field to select the archive you created.

#. Specify the versions in the **Upgrade from** and **Upgrade to** fields.

#. (Optional) Enter **Package description**.

#. Click **Create**.

View and Test Your Upgrade Packages
===================================

The list of upgrade packages is available on the **Product packages** tab of your add-on:

.. image:: img/packages.png
    :align: center
    :alt: The list of packages includes add-on distribution and upgrade packages.

A manually-uploaded upgrade package has the *Active* status by default, i.e. it is available to customers. Upgrades built with the Marketplace have the *Disabled* status by default, i.e. they are not available to customers.

Customers who :doc:`downloaded an add-on from the Marketplace </user_guide/addons/marketplace_addons>`, installed it, and specified the marketplace license number, will see the active upgrades in the Upgrade Center.

If you want to test a disabled upgrade package, add the following line to your store’s :doc:`local_conf.php </developer_guide/getting_started/configuring_cscart>`:

.. code-block:: php

    $config['resources']['marketplace_url'] .= '?access_token=/*your token here*/';

You'll find the access token on your profile editing page in the Marketplace:
