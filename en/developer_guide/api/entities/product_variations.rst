Product Variations
******************

Starting with version 4.10.1, this entity no longer exists. :doc:`Variations </user_guide/manage_products/products/product_variations>` are products with :doc:`some additional properties </user_guide/manage_products/import_export/variation_import>`, and should be managed via the :doc:`"products" <products>` entity.

To see how the ``product_variations`` entity worked in older versions, `check the documentation for 4.9.x <https://docs.cs-cart.com/4.9.x/developer_guide/api/entities/product_variations.html>`_.
