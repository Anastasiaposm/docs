CS-Cart Software Was Not Found in the Directory You Entered
***********************************************************

If you see the **"CS-Cart software was not found in the directory you entered"** error message, check the FTP account options entered for the Upgrade Center:

1. Open the Administration panel of your store.

2. Go to **Settings â†’ Upgrade Center**.

3. Check the values in the **FTP server options** section. The **Directory** input field should have the name of the directory on the server where CS-Cart is installed. For example, if CS-Cart is installed in the **store** directory, enter **/store** in that field.
