Upgrade CS-Cart
***************

There are different ways to upgrade CS-Cart.

==============
Upgrade Center
============== 

Starting with CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor 4.0.x, you can use the **Upgrade Center** to upgrade your store to the latest version:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2
    :titlesonly:
    :glob:

    upgrade_process
    resolve_conflicts
    cscart_not_found
    possible_upgrade_issues

===================
Upgrade via Console
===================

Starting with version 4.4.3, you can upgrade CS-Cart and Multi-Vendor via the command line.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2
    :titlesonly:
    :glob:

    upgrade_via_console

============
Store Import
============ 

You can use the **Store Import** add-on to upgrade your store from versions 2.2.4/2.2.5 or 3.0.x to CS-Cart or Multi-Vendor 4.x.x.
The upgrade is done by creating a separate CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor installation and using the add-on to import data from your old store.

    store_import_technical_details

==========
DIFF Files
========== 

When we fix a bug, the fix is usually included in one of the future versions of CS-Cart. But it may take a while for a new version to be released, and a bug needs to be fixed now. Thatâ€™s why we provide files in the unified DIFF format.
