    This functionality exists only in Multi-Vendor 4.7.1 and newer. It is available as a part of the :doc:`Customer-to-Vendor Communication </user_guide/addons/customer_to_vendor_communication/index>` add-on.

Whenever a customer sends a message to a vendor by using the **Contact vendor** button, a new thread is created. A **thread** is a sequence of messages in the communication between a customer and a vendor.

Messages and threads are saved to the database and can be viewed in the **Message Center**, both in the Administration panel and on the storefront. That way customers and vendors can check the communication history and continue their conversations in the relevant threads.

==========================
Message Center for Vendors
==========================

The **Customers → Message center** page in the administration panel allows vendors to:

* **View threads** started by customers when they contacted the vendor. For convenience, the threads with new messages from customers are highlighted.
