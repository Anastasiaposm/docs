    This functionality exists only in Multi-Vendor 4.7.1 and newer. It is available as a part of the :doc:`Customer-to-Vendor Communication </user_guide/addons/customer_to_vendor_communication/index>` add-on.

Whenever a customer sends a message to a vendor by using the **Contact vendor** button, a new thread is created. A **thread** is a sequence of messages in the communication between a customer and a vendor.

Messages and threads are saved to the database and can be viewed in the **Message Center**, both in the Administration panel and on the storefront. That way customers, administrators, and vendors can check the communication history and continue their conversations in the relevant threads.

=============================================
Message Center for Administrators and Vendors
=============================================

The **Customers → Message center** page is available to administrators and vendors' administrators in their respective administration panels. That page allows them to:

* **View threads** started by customers. For convenience, the threads with new messages from customers that haven't been checked by either an administrator or a vendor's administrator are highlighted.

  .. note::

      :doc:`A vendor's administrator </user_guide/users/vendors/index>` can only see the messages directed to his or her vendor.

* **Send new messages** in existing threads. Just click on the ID of the thread, type your message, and click **Send**.

  .. note::

    Depending on :doc:`the add-on's settings </user_guide/addons/customer_to_vendor_communication/set_up_communication>`, customers, administrators, and vendors may receive email notifications about new messages.

* **Delete threads** by hovering over a thread, clicking the gear button and choosing **Delete**.

  .. important::

      Threads can only be deleted by global (non-vendor) administrators.

Message Center for Customers
============================

The **My Account → Messages** page allows customers to:

* **View their own threads.** For convenience, the threads with new messages from vendors are highlighted.
