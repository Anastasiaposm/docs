Issues with Logging in to the Administration Panel
**************************************************

If you encounter problems when you attempt to sign in to the administration panel of CS-Cart or Multi-Vendor, then one of the following solutions might help:

#. Make sure that you enter the correct email and password. Use the email address you entered when you installed CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor.

   .. hint::

       If you can't remember your password to the administration panel, use the **Forgot your password?** link.

       :alt: The Forgot your password? link allows you to reset your password.

#. Clear the browser cache.

   .. hint::

       Different browsers have different methods of clearing cache, but the standard key combination to do it is **Ctrl+R**.

#. Clear the template cache: delete the **var/cache** directory of your store. For remote servers, use an FTP client, SSH client or the file manager of your web hosting control panel to do it.

If you still can't access the panel, submit a ticket in our `Customer Help Desk <https://www.cs-cart.com/helpdesk>`_ and provide us with a temporary FTP access to your server.
