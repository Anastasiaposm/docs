How To: Invite Vendors
**********************

.. important::

    This functionality is available only in **Multi-Vendor**.

A marketplace sells products from many different vendors. The more vendors, the better. If you have email addresses of potential vendors, you'll be able to send them invitations to your marketplace by email. To invite a vendor:

#. Go to **Vendors → Vendors** in the administration panel of your marketplace.

#. Click the **Invite vendors** button.

#. Enter the emails of the people whom you'd like to invite to the marketplace as vendors. If you have more than one address, enter each one in a new line.

   .. note::

       An invitation won't be sent to an email address that already exists in the system, or to which it has already been sent.

   .. hint::

       Use the link in the vendor invitation pop-up to edit the structure of the invitation email. Edit the texts of the email in **Administration → Languages → Translations**.
