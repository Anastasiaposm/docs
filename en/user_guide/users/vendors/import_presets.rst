How to: Make Import Easier for Vendors
**************************************

The quickest way for vendors to upload their products to marketplace is to import a file that contains those products. Files may have the different structure. You can configure the Multi-Vendor to recognize different files—this is what import presets are made for. If you have presets configured, any vendor can use them to upload his products.

How to Create Import Presets for Vendors
========================================

#. Open the **Administration → Import Data → Products page**.

#. Create a :doc:`new import preset </user_guide/manage_products/import_export/advanced_product_import>`.

#. The new preset will appear in the **Marketplace Presets** section.

How Do Vendors Import Products via Marketplace Presets
======================================================

When import presets are already configured by marketplace owner, everything what is left to do for vendors is to choose a preset and upload the file. Supported file extensions are displayed in the settings of any preset.

Vendors have the ability to:

* create their own presets for import;

* delete and edit only their own presets;

* clone the marketplace presets to the **Vendor’s presets section** to get the ability to change them.
