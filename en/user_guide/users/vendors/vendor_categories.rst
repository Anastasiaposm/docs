**********************
Vendors and Categories
**********************

.. important::

    **Vendors** are available only in **Multi-Vendor**.

By default, vendors can create products in all the categories of a store. However, you limit the list of categories available to a vendor via the :doc:`Vendor Plans </user_guide/addons/vendor_plans/index>` add-on. Then the vendor will be able to add products to those categories only.

===========================================
Change the Categories Available to a Vendor
===========================================

#. In the administration panel, go to **Vendors â†’ Vendor plans**.

#. Click the plan you want to edit.

#. Switch to the **Categories** tab.

#. Use the **Add categories** button to add the categories to the list.

#. Click **Save** for the changes to take effect.

   .. important::

       If there are no categories on the list, then the vendor will have access to all the categories of the store.

===================================
Categories in a Vendor's Microstore
===================================

Multi-Vendor has a feature called **vendor's microstore**, that shows the products of a specific vendor only. A vendor's microstore only displays the categories that have products.

.. important::

    A category will show up in a vendor's microstore even if it has hidden and/or disabled products only. The workaround is to move hidden/disabled products to a special hidden/disabled category created for that purpose.
