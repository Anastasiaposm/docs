    **Vendors** are available only in **Multi-Vendor**.

The money from all purchases in a Multi-Vendor store goes to the store owner. The owner then manually splits the money among vendors and then registers these payouts.

The root administrator can review the income and expenditure statistics (total, per vendor, per period) and register payouts to vendors under **Vendors → Account balance**.

This section contains the sorted list of all vendors, incomes, and payouts. To filter the list, use the search form to the right of the list. To make the search results more precise, use the **Advanced search** option.

Every entry on the list has the following attributes:

* **Vendor**—name of the vendor.

* **Sales period**—period for which the income was earned or the expenditure was made.

* **Payment amount**—the amount paid.

* **Date**—date when the order was placed.

* **Vendor commission**—the amount of money subtracted from the vendor's income towards your commission for selling this vendor's products in your store. The size of the commission is defined on the vendor's profile page.

* **Payment**—the payment method through which the vendor received the payment. If the entry represents the store income, you will see the ID of the customer order containing the vendor products.

* **Comments**—administrator's comments on the payout; click the **expand** button (grey arrow) to see the comments.

Below the list you can see the detailed accounting information:
