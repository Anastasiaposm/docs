*********************************
How To: Merge Two Vendor Accounts
*********************************

.. important::

    **Vendors** are available only in **Multi-Vendor**.

When you merge *vendor account A* into *vendor account B*, *vendor account A* is removed from the store database, and all its account data (products, orders, shipping methods, users, promotions, etc.) is automatically assigned to *vendor account B*.

To merge two vendor accounts, complete the following steps:

#. Go to **Vendors â†’ Vendors** in the Administration panel.

#. Click the **gear** button of the vendor account that you want to merge into another vendor account.

#. Select the **Merge** action.

   .. warning::

       Please double-check which account you are handling at this step, because it is the account that will be removed from the database in the end.

#. Select the vendor account that will inherit all data associated from the account that is being disposed of.

#. Click the **Merge** button.
