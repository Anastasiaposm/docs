*********************************
How To: Merge Two Vendor Accounts
*********************************

.. important::

    **Vendors** are available only in **Multi-Vendor**.

When you merge *vendor account A* into *vendor account B*, *vendor account A* is removed from the store database, and all its account data (products, orders, shipping methods, users, promotions, etc.) is automatically assigned to *vendor account B*.

To merge two vendor accounts, complete the following steps:

1. Go to **Vendors â†’ Vendors** in the Administration panel.

2. Click the **gear** button of the vendor account that you want to merge into another vendor account.

3. Select the **Merge** action.

.. warning::

    Please double-check which account you are handling at this step, because it is the account that will be removed from the database in the end.

4. Select the vendor account that will inherit all data associated from the account that is being disposed of.

5. Click the **Merge** button.
