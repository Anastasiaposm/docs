********************************************
How To: Approve/Disapprove Vendors' Products
********************************************

.. note::

    This functionality is available only in **Multi-Vendor**.

Some marketplace owners want to check the products of their vendors before showing these products to customers. In Multi-Vendor, you can achieve this via the :doc:`/user_guide/addons/vendor_data_premoderation/index` add-on. For marketplace owners, the add-on provides new pages in the **Vendors → Moderation** section:

* The **Products** page:

  * The **Products on moderation** tab contains all the products that need to be reviewed by marketplace administrators. Vendors can see the product status here, and administrators see the *Approve* (thumbs up) and *Disapprove* (thumbs down) buttons.

  * The **Disapproved products** tab contains all the products that were rejected by the marketplace administrators for some reason. These products have the *Disapproved* status. Vendors can check what products have been rejected and edit them. Once they do it, products will be on moderation again. Marketplace administrators can approve products from here by changing their status.

    .. hint::

        Select multiple products by clicking on them or using the checkbox in the upper left corner. That way you'll be able to approve and disapprove them in bulk via the menu that will appear above them.

  * The **Pending vendor invitation** contains the list of all e-mails, to which administrator sent invitations to register as vendors in the marketplace.
