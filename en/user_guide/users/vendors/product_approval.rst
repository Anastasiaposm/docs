How To: Approve/Disapprove Vendors' Products
********************************************

.. important::

    **Vendors** are available only in **Multi-Vendor**.

Some store owners may want to check the products of their vendors before they appear in the store.

If you want to be able to approve/disapprove vendors' products, activate and configure the **Vendor Data Premoderation** add-on under **Add-ons → Manage add-ons**. Otherwise you won't find the **Product approval** section.

===============================
Approving/Disapproving Products
===============================

To approve/disapprove a product, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Administration panel as the **root administrator**. 

2. Go to **Vendors → Product approval**. This will display a list of all products in the store.

3. If necessary, use the search form to the right of the list to filter the products.

4. Click either the **Approve** or **Disapprove** icon of the required product. 

.. hint::

    To approve/disapprove several products at once, tick the checkboxes of the required products and click the **Approve selected** or **Disapprove selected** button above the list.

This will open a pop-up form where you can specify a reason for approval/disapproval and choose whether to send an email notification to the vendor(s).

================
Product Statuses
================

Every product on the list can have one of the following statuses:

* **Approved**—the product has been approved by the root administrator.

* **Disapproved**—the product has been disapproved by the root administrator.

* **Pending**—the product is waiting for approval.

Products added by vendors may or may not require root administrator's approval. New products get the **Pending** status, if the **Products require prior approval** setting is enabled in the profile of the vendor who adds the products.

.. note::

    The root administrator gets notified of pending products when logging in to the administration panel.
