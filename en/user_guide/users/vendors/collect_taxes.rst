.. note::

    To collect taxes from vendors, and send them to marketplace owner, you need the :doc:`Vendor plans </user_guide/addons/vendor_plans/index>` add-on.
    
By default, all the taxes on marketplace are paid by vendors, but marketplace owner can make all the taxes to be sent to his account.

    In some states U.S. tax laws impose an obligation on marketplace owners to collect and remit sales tax on behalf of marketplace sellers. Check out the `state-by-state guide to marketplace facilitator laws <https://www.avalara.com/us/en/learn/guides/state-by-state-guide-to-marketplace-facilitator-laws.html>`_ .
