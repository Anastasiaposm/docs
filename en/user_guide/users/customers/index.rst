**Customers** can have their own accounts in your store.

You can find the list of registered customer accounts under **Customers → Customers**. This section works as described :doc:`in this document <../index>`.

   If you are a :doc:`vendor's administrator <../vendors/index>`, you will be able to view the accounts and details of only those customers, who have at least one existing order placed with your vendor.
