User Groups

**User groups** can be regarded as different membership levels. You can use groups to control access to products and categories, as well as shipping and payment methods. 

Products can also have different prices, depending on a customer's user group.

Administrator user groups allow you to set various restrictions for administrators—use that to create accounts with limited permissions for your staff.

The **User Groups** section under **Customers → User Groups** contains a list of user groups that exist in your store.
