*******************************

.. important::

    You can manage multiple storefronts from one administration panel in `CS-Cart Ultimate <https://helpdesk.cs-cart.com/cs-cart-ultimate-license.html>`_ and `Multi-Vendor Ultimate <https://multivendor.cs-cart.ru/#compare>`_.

#. Go to **Administration â†’ Storefronts**.

#. Click the **+** button to open the storefront creation form.

#. Specify the properties of the new storefront.

   .. note::

       In CS-Cart, you can copy or share objects (such as products, categories, menus, layouts) from one your existing storefronts to the one you're creating. In Multi-Vendor Ultimate you can copy only theme and its layouts from another storefront.

#. Click **Create**, and the storefront will be added.
