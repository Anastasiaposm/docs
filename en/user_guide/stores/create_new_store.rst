    To manage multiple storefronts with one administration panel, `purchase additional storefront licenses <http://www.cs-cart.com/cs-cart-storefront-license.html>`_ or specify the desired number of storefronts when you `buy a CS-Cart license <http://www.cs-cart.com/cs-cart-license.html>`_. Starting with version 4.4.2, there is also `CS-Cart Ultimate <https://www.cs-cart.com/cs-cart-ultimate-license.html>`_, which offers an unlimited number of storefronts.
