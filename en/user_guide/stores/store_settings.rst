***************************************
Global and Storefront-Specific Settings
***************************************

=============
Setting Types
=============

When working with multiple storefronts, remember that CS-Cart has different types of settings:

* **Global settings** affect overall store functionality and the behavior of the Administration panel. They include logging, usage of secure connection in the administration panel, base for tax calculation methods, and so on.

* **Storefront-specific settings** affect a particular storefront and its behavior. These settings include storefront appearance options (for example, thumbnail dimensions), usage of secure connection at checkout, company information, and so on.

.. note::
    Different storefronts also have different block placement, site maps, menus, etc.

==================
Configure Settings
==================

The general rule for updating settings is as follows:

* To update **storefront-specific settings**, choose the desired storefront in the selector in the upper left part of the page.


* To update **global settings**, choose *All storefronts* in the selector in the upper left part of the page.
