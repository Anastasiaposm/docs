CS-Cart allows you to manage multiple stores with one administration panel. Every store has a separate storefront,  settings, and checkout mechanism, so that visitors can treat them as independent stores. This section of the documentation describes how to work with multiple stores.

To configure multiple storefronts on your web hosting, please :doc:`follow the inistructions <../../install/storefronts/index>`.

.. note::
    Unless you use CS-Cart Ultimate, youâ€™ll need to `purchase additional storefront licenses <http://www.cs-cart.com/cs-cart-storefront-license.html>`_, if you want to manage multiple stores with one Administration panel. You can also specify the desired number of storefronts when you `buy a CS-Cart license <http://www.cs-cart.com/cs-cart-license.html>`_.
