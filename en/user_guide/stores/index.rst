`CS-Cart Ultimate <https://helpdesk.cs-cart.com/cs-cart-ultimate-license.html>`_ and `Multi-Vendor Ultimate <https://helpdesk.cs-cart.com/multi-vendor-ultimate-license.html>`_ allow you to manage multiple storefronts with one administration panel.

In CS-Cart, storefronts can have their own products, categories, settings, and checkout mechanism, so that visitors can treat them as independent stores. This section of the documentation describes how to work with multiple storefronts.
