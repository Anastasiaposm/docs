CS-Cart allows you to manage multiple stores with one administration panel. Every store has a separate storefront,  settings, and checkout mechanism, so that visitors can treat them as independent stores. This section of the documentation describes how to work with multiple stores.

To configure multiple storefronts on your web hosting, please :doc:`follow the inistructions <../../install/storefronts/index>`.

.. note::
    If you want to manage multiple stores with one administration panel, youâ€™ll need to `purchase additional storefront licenses <http://www.cs-cart.com/cs-cart-storefront-license.html>`_ or specify the desired number of storefronts when you `buy a CS-Cart license <http://www.cs-cart.com/cs-cart-license.html>`_.
