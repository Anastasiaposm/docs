    This article applies only to CS-Cart, not Multi-Vendor.

CS-Cart allows you to manage multiple storefronts with one administration panel. Storefronts can have their own products, categories, settings, and checkout mechanism, so that visitors can treat them as independent stores. This section of the documentation describes how to work with multiple storefronts.

To configure multiple storefronts on your web hosting, please :doc:`follow these inistructions. <../../install/storefronts/index>`

.. note::

    To manage multiple storefronts with one Administration panel, `purchase additional storefront licenses <http://www.cs-cart.com/cs-cart-storefront-license.html>`_ or specify the desired number of storefronts when you `buy a CS-Cart license <http://www.cs-cart.com/cs-cart-license.html>`_. Starting with version 4.4.2, there is also `CS-Cart Ultimate <https://www.cs-cart.com/cs-cart-ultimate-license.html>`_, which offers an unlimited number of storefronts.
