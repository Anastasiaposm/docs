******************************************
Customer Accounts and Multiple Storefronts
******************************************

.. important::

    This article applies only to CS-Cart, not Multi-Vendor.

CS-Cart offers 2 ways of handling customer accounts:

* **One customer base shared among all storefronts**

  All storefronts will recognize a customer once he or she has registered on any other storefront. However, it may confuse your customers, especially if they're supposed to see your storefronts as separate stores.

* **Different customer bases for each storefront** (recommended)

  Customers will have to create accounts separately for each storefront.

.. important::

    To choose either of the options, use the **Share users among stores** checkbox in **Settings â†’ Stores**.
