******************************************
Customer Accounts and Multiple Storefronts
******************************************

.. important::

    This article applies only to CS-Cart Ultimate. In Multi-Vendor Ultimate, the customer base is always shared by all storefronts.

The **Share users among stores** setting in **Settings â†’ Stores** determines how CS-Cart handles customer accounts:

* **One customer base shared among all storefronts**

  All storefronts will recognize a customer once he or she has registered on any other storefront. However, it may confuse your customers, especially if they're supposed to see your storefronts as separate stores.

* **Different customer bases for each storefront** (recommended)

  Customers will have to create accounts separately for each storefront.
