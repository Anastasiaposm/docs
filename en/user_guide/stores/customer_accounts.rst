*************************************
Customer Accounts and Multiple Stores
*************************************

CS-Cart offers 2 ways of handling customer accounts:

* One customer base shared among all stores

All stores will recognize a customer once he or she has registered in any other store. However, it may confuse your customers, if they're supposed to consider your stores independent from each other.

* Different customer bases for each store

Customers will have separate accounts in every store of yours. This is the recommended option.

To choose either of the options, use the **Share users among stores** checkbox in **Settings â†’ Stores**.
