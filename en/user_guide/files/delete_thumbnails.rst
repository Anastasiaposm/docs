Regenerating Thumbnails
***********************

People usually upload large images for products, options, etc. These images are too large for the product list or product details page, so smaller images are generated from them automatically. These smaller images are called **thumbnails**.

There are times when you may need to re-generate those images. For example, you do it when you see :doc:`incorrect thumbnails on the storefront. <../manage_products/products/incorrect_thumbnails>`

To delete the generated thumbnails and create new ones automatically, go to **Administration → Storage → Clean up generated thumbnails**.
