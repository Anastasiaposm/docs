Regenerating Thumbnails
***********************

People usually upload large images for products, options, etc. These images are too large for the product list or product details page, so smaller images are generated from them. These smaller images are called **thumbnails**.

Thumbnails are stored in thumbnail cache. If there was an error in product generating or during the import, you may need to clear thumbnail cache to regenerate those images. For example, you do it when you see :doc:`incorrect thumbnails on the storefront <../manage_products/products/incorrect_thumbnails>`.

To clean up the thumbnail cache, go to **Administration → Storage → Clean up generated thumbnails**.
