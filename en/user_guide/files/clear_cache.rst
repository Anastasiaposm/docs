******************
Clearing the Cache
******************

Cache is the space on your computer's hard drive and in RAM memory where your browser saves the copies of previously visited web pages. Deleting the cache files is useful in 2 situations:
 
* The cache is out of date, and the saved files no longer match the files on the web server.

* The cache occupies too much hard drive space.

To clear cache on your computer, go to **Administration → Storage → Clear cache**.

.. important::

    To clear the cache manually, delete the *var/cache* directory of your store.
