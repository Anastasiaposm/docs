Payment Methods
***************

In this section, you can adjust the set of payment methods that your customers can use to pay for their orders. For convenience, all methods are arranged in a single list representing the name of the method, its current status, and a few control elements.

.. note::

    If your realtime shipping method does not pass shipping rates from the shipping service server, or orders get the **Failed** status after they are paid using a payment processor, :doc:`please refer to this article </user_guide/shipping_and_taxes/shipping_methods/realtime_shipping_methods/realtime_shipping_and_payment_problem>`.
