Call Requests

.. important::

    To allow call requests in your store, go to **Add-ons → Manage add-ons** and make sure that the :doc:`Call requests </user_guide/addons/call_requests/index>` add-on is active.

The list of call requests is available on the **Orders → Call requests** page. Customers make those requests by clicking the **Request call** link on the storefront. This link is a part of the **Call requests** block that you can place anywhere by using the **Design → Layouts** functionality.

.. note::

    Every call request contains links to any products that are in the customer's cart at the moment when the request is made.

The add-on also enables you to add **Buy now with 1-click** links to all products in your store. When a customer clicks such a link on the product details page and fills in the form, a call request will be generated as well. In addition to all the products in the cart, this call request will include a separate link to the selected product.

If the customer fills the **Email** field, then an order for the selected product will also be placed.

You can see the following information for each call request on the **Orders → Call requests** page:

* **ID**—the identifier of the request.

* **Date**—the date and time when a request was made.

* **Name and phone**—the name and phone of a customer who sent the request (if this data was provided).

* **Order/Status**—the identifier and status of the associated order (if the order was placed with **Buy now with 1-click**).

* **Responsible**—an administrator responsible for contacting the customer.

* **Status**—the status of a call request.

In this list you can also see the products in cart and the convenient time for calling a customer.

To add some notes for a call request, just type them in the **Notes** field.

To change a request status, click on the current one in the **Status** column and choose the required status from the drop-down menu:

* **New**—no work has been done on the call request yet.

* **In progress**—an administrator is working on the request.

* **Completed**—the call was made.

* **No answer**—the call was made, but there was no answer.

To delete a call request, hover the mouse pointer over it. You will see a gear button. Click it and choose **Delete**. To delete multiple requests at once, tick the checkboxes on the left, click the gear button in the right top part of the page, and choose **Delete selected**.
