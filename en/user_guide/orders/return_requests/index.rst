Return Requests
***************

The **Orders → Return requests** page allows you to handle product return requests that your customers have registered. It also allows you to configure the general product return policy of your store.

.. note::

    To allow return requests in your store, activate the :doc:`RMA </user_guide/addons/rma/index>`  add-on on the **Add-ons → Manage add-ons** page. There you can also configure some essential settings that relate to return requests.

The section consists of four subsections: **Return requests**, **RMA reasons**, **RMA actions**, and **RMA request statuses**. To switch between the subsections, use the gear button on the right.
