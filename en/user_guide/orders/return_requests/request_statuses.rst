RMA Request Statuses
********************

By default, there are four possible statuses for return requests: 

* *Approved*

* *Complete*

* *Declined*

* *Requested* 

The *Requested* status is automatically assigned to all newly-submitted requests, and then the store administrator can manually change the request status. If necessary, you can add a custom status:

#. Go to **Orders → Return requests**.

#. Click the gear button in the right upper corner of the page and choose **RMA request statuses**.

#. Click the **+** button in the right upper corner of the page and choose **Add status**. 

#. A pop-up window will open. Fill in the form:

   * **Name**—the name of the status.

   * **E-mail subject**—the subject of an email message that is sent to customers automatically when the request gets this status.

   * **E-mail header**—the text of an email message that is sent to customers automatically when the request gets this status.

   * **Inventory**—choose whether to decrease or increase the number of items in stock for products included in the return request.
	
#. Click the **Create** button.

   .. note::

       You can also edit or delete statuses: click the **gear button** while hovering the mouse pointer over the status and choose the required action. Default statuses can not be deleted.
