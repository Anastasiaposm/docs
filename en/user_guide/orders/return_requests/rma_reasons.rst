RMA Reasons
***********

When submitting a return request, customers are asked to specify a reason why they want to return a particular product. The store administrator can adjust the default set of reasons by adding or removing reasons. It is also possible to enable or disable a certain reason, which is useful when you need to temporarily deactivate the reason, but plan to use it again later.

===========================
Enabling/Disabling a Reason
===========================

#. Go to **Orders → Return requests**.

#. Click the gear button in the right upper part of the page and choose **RMA reasons**.

    You can also change the wording of the reason and it's position.
