RMA actions are the actions that a customer may expect to be taken towards his or her return requests: replacing an item or making a refund. Customers are asked to choose a preferable action when they submit a return request. If a particular action is not applicable in your store, you can disable the action:

#. Go to **Orders â†’ Return requests**.

#. Click the gear button in the upper right part of the page and choose **RMA actions**.

#. Click on the status of the action and choose the desired status.
