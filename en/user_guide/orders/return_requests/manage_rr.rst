How To: Manage Return Requests
******************************

The **Orders → Return requests** page contains the list of product return requests. You can sort or filter the list according to different parameters. To filter the requests, use the search panel to the right of the list.

To handle a particular request, click the gear button corresponding to the request and choose **Edit**. This will open the request details (split into four tabs):

* **Return products information**—the list of products from the request that are or will be approved for the return.

* **Declined products information**—the list of products from the request that are or will be declined for the return.

* **Comments**—the comments about the requested return.

* **Actions**—the actions that you can perform on the return request to handle it.

#. Tick the checkboxes of the products for which you'd like to approve the return.

#. Click the **Accept products** button above the list.

The products will appear in the list of products approved for the return.

====================

You can print a packing slip for requested product returns.

To print a slip for an individual request:

#. Go to **Orders → Return requests**.

#. Click on the ID of the request.

   .. important::

       A packing slip includes only those products that are approved for the return.

===============================
Issue a Credit/Gift Certificate
===============================

For each approved product from a return request, you can issue a gift certificate which covers exactly the cost of the returned product. Alternatively, you can issue one gift certificate for all approved products from the request. In this case, the certificate's worth will be the same as the original subtotal of the returned products.

To issue a gift certificate:

#. Go to **Orders → Return requests**.

#. Click on the ID of the request. You'll see the **Return products information** tab.

#. Tick the checkboxes of the required products.

#. Click the **Create gift certificate** button above the list of approved products.

#. If prompted, confirm the action.

The code of the new certificate will appear above the tabs.
