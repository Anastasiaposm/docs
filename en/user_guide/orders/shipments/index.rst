CS-Cart and Multi-Vendor allow you to ship items from a single order in multiple batches and/or at different periods of time. These batches are treated as separate **shipments** of one order. This is useful when you have to deal with backorders regularly.

For example, if a customer orders several items that are out of stock, you can ship the in-stock items once the order has been placed, and send the remaining items at a later date as a separate shipment.
