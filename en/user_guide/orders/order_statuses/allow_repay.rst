How To: Allow Customer to Pay for Order Once Again
**************************************************

.. important::

    For this to work, the **Allow customers to pay order again if transaction was declined** setting must be enabled in **Settings → Checkout**. It is usually enabled by default.

#. In the Administration panel, go to **Administration → Order statuses**.

#. Click on the name of a status.

#. Tick the **Pay order again** checkbox.

#. Click the **Save** button.

   If an order has one of the statuses with the **Pay order again** setting turned on, the customer will be able to pay for the order again on the order details page on the storefront.
