How To: Remove Credit Card Information from Orders Automatically
****************************************************************

By default, credit card information is removed automatically from orders with any status. But if you have created a new order status and you want the credit card information to be removed from orders with that status automatically:

#. In the Administration panel, go to **Administration â†’ Order statuses**.

#. Click on the name of the status.

#. Tick the **Remove CC info** checkbox.

#. Click **Save**.

   When an order gets a status for which the **Remove CC info**  setting turned on, the credit card information will be removed from that order.
