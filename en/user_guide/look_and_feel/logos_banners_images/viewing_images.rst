How To: Manage Thumbnails
*************************

Thumbnails are smaller versions of images that you upload to the site. Thumbnails are used wherever a full-size image isn't necessary. Thanks to the smaller size of thumbnails, pages load faster.

By default, product thumbnails are generated automatically from the images you upload. :doc:`You can change the size of thumbnails </user_guide/look_and_feel/changing_attributes/change_image_size>` on the **Settings → Thumbnails** page.

Once you change the settings, delete the old thumbnails; new ones will be generated automatically. To delete thumbnails, go to **Administration → Storage** and choose **Clean up generated thumbnails**.
