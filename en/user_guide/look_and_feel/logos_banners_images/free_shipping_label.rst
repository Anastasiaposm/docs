How To: Display Free Shipping Label for a Product
*************************************************

In previous versions of CS-Cart and Multi-Vendor a free shipping lable required `a custom modification <https://github.com/cscart/addon-free-shipping-label/>`_. Starting with version 4.10.1, it is no longer necessary: the label appears automatically for products that can be shipped for free.

#. In the administration panel, go to **Products â†’ Products**.

#. Open the editing page of the product that should be shipped for free.

#. Switch to the **Shipping properties** tab.

#. Enable the **Free shipping** setting.

#. Save your changes. The product should now have "Free shipping" label next to its image on the product list and on the product details page.
