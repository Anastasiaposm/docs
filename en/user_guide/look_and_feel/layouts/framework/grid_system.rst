CS-Cart uses the intuitive and powerful `Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/>`_ framework that can have the full-, custom-width, and responsive layout. The layout in CS-Cart has 12- or 16-column structure.

In the full-width layout the length of the columns is adapted to the width of the page. In custom-width layout the length of the columns is fixed and depends on the specified width of the page. And responsive layout is flexible and easily adapting for different screen sizes. It is very useful for displaying site content on the portable devices screens.

In CS-Cart, the root containers always occupy the full page length, i.e. all columns in the grid. The number of columns is defined through the container settings. It determines the possible dimensions of child containers. Their length cannot exceed the number of columns in the grid.
