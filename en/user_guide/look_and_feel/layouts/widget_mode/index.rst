Widget Mode
***********

You can embed your store in any other web-page thanks to the **Widget Mode**. 

Go to **Design → Layouts**, and in the upper right part of the  screen you'll see the **Widget code**. Copy this code and use it to embed your store as a widget in any other web page.

Click the **NEED HELP** button at the top of a page to see `the video describing the features of the Widget mode <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RseUfuFdctg>`_.

    Some websites don’t allow external JavaScript files, so the CS-Cart widget will not work on such sites.
