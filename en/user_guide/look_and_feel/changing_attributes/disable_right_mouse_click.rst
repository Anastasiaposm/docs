How To: Disable Right Mouse Click to Protect Images
***************************************************

Most browsers allow users to copy any image from a web page by clicking on the image with the right mouse button and choosing the corresponding action from the list. If you don't want the visitors of your store to copy and save images, you can disable the right mouse click in your store.

.. note::

    Disabling the right mouse click does not guarantee full protection of your images, it simply creates an additional deterrent. There are many other ways to copy an image from a web page. For example, a visitor can simply save the web page, and all images on that page will be saved on the visitor's computer.
