Look & Behavior Tweaks
**********************

This section covers various ways of changing CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor behavior and appearance via settings or modifications. We provide some of those modifications as free add-ons.

.. note::

    We advise using add-ons instead of direct code modificationsâ€”that way you won't have to reapply the changes after the upgrade. And if there are any problems, it's easy to disable an add-on.
