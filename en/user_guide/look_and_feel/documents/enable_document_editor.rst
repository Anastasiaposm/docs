******************************
How To: Enable Document Editor
******************************

By default, the document editor is disabled for those who upgrade from earlier versions of CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor to 4.4.1 via the Upgrade Center. This was done to preserve maximum compatibility with the third-party add-on you might have.

If you don’t see **Documents** when you open the **Design** menu, the editor is probably disabled. To enable it, follow these steps:

#. Go to **Settings → Appearance**.

#. Find the **Email templates mode** setting.

#. Choose *New (nice and editable from the admin panel)* from the dropdown list.

#. Click **Save** in the top right corner of the page.

    Once you do this, the settings that concern email notifications will disappear from **Administration → Statuses → Order statuses**. You’ll be able to manage email notifications about order status changes under **Design → Email templates**.
