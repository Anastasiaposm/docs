*************************************************************
How To: Assign Notifications to Specific Users or User Groups
*************************************************************

Starting with version 4.12.1 of CS-Cart and Multi-Vendor, you can decide what email notifications to send, and who will receive them.

Let’s say you want your order manager to only receive notifications of orders, and your administrator  — to receive notifications of vendors and their statuses. To do this:

#. Go to **Administration → Notifications**.

#. Choose the notifications section and click **Manage**.

#. In the new window specify the recipients:

   * one or multiple :doc:`user groups </user_guide/users/user_groups/index>`;
   
   * one or multiple users (for example, specific :doc:`administrators </user_guide/users/administrators/index>`);
   
   * specific email adresses (available only on the **Administrator notifications** tab).
   
#. Click the **Apply** button.
