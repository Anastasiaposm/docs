Pages

The **Website → Pages** section lets you create and publish new content of the following types:

* **Page**—a simple page that can only contain a text formatted in HTML. Good for various descriptions and policies.

* **Form** (requires the :doc:`Form Builder </user_guide/addons/form_builder/index>` add-on)—a page that contains a contact form and optionally a text formatted in HTML. A user-friendly form builder doesn't require any technical skills (such as HTML knowledge).

* **Poll** (requires the :doc:`Polls </user_guide/addons/polls/index>` add-on)—a survey or a questionnaire.

* **Link**—a reference to an external web resource or any page of your web site. It serves two purposes:

  * It can appear among other content pages when you :doc:`create a new block </user_guide/look_and_feel/layouts/blocks/actions_on_blocks>` of the "Pages" type.

  * It lets you create links that seemingly belong to your site, but lead to your other resources, such as Facebook page.

    So, instead of giving your customers a link to ``https://www.facebook.com/example.company/``, you can give them a link like ``https://example.com/facebook`` that will lead to the same Facebook page.

    .. note::

        To use a link in this manner, the :doc:`SEO </user_guide/addons/seo/index>` add-on must be active. Otherwise, the link will look like this: ``http://example.com/?dispatch=pages.view&page_id=%pid%``.
