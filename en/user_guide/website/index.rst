The **Website** section of the administration panel allows you to create, edit, and publish supplementary content. Usually this content has nothing to do with the product catalog and e-commerce functionality of the website; it provides additional information like the description of your company, your privacy policy, forms to contact the store administration, surveys and questionnaires, etc.

In this section you can:

* manage a :doc:`blog <../addons/blog/index>` of your store;

* create and modify pages, links and :doc:`forms <../addons/form_builder/create_form>`;

* manage :doc:`tags <../addons/tags/index>` of products and content pages;

* specify :doc:`SEO rules <../addons/seo/seo_rules>`, :doc:`301 redirects <../addons/seo/301_redirects>` and configure :doc:`robots.txt <robots>` (`learn more at www.robotstxt.org <http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html>`_);

* manage :doc:`reviews and comments <../addons/comments_and_reviews/enable_comments_addon>`;

* manage :doc:`testimonials <../addons/comments_and_reviews/testimonials>`;

* configure :doc:`sitemap <sitemap>`.

.. important::

    *Blog*, *Tags*, *Social login*, *Testimonials*, *Comments and reviews*, *301 redirects*, and *SEO rules* won't appear in the **Website** section unless you activate the corresponding add-ons.
