    :alt: Products list

Each entry in the list has the following attributes:

*	**Image** – Product thumbnail.
*	**Name** – Name of the product and the internal product code (SKU number). This number must not necessarily be unique, or it can even be missing.
*	**Price** – Product price.
*	**List price** – Price suggested by the product manufacturer. Good practice is to show that your price is lower than the list price.
*	**Quantity** – Number of products in the stock.
*	**Status** – *Active* – product is available on the storefront, *Disabled* – product is not available on the storefront, or *Hidden* – product does not appear on the storefront, but customers can access it via a direct link.

These attributes can be changed on the fly without opening the product for editing.
