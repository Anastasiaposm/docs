********************************************************
How To: Turn Option Combinations into Product Variations
********************************************************

.. warning::

    The described functionality was removed in version 4.10.1. Products are no longer divided into simple or configurable, and variations are now based on features rather than options.

If your store existed before version 4.6.1, then it already has products. After you upgrade to version 4.6.1, all those products will be considered *simple*. However, if you want to take advantage of :doc:`the new opportunities provided by product variations <simple_versus_configurable>`, you'll be able to convert a simple product and its option combinations into a configurable product and its variations.

To turn a simple product into configurable:

#. Go to **Products â†’ Products** in the Administration panel of your store.

#. Click the name of a simple product for which you'd like to create variations.

#. The editing page of the product will open. Click the **gear** button in the upper right part of the page and choose **Convert to configurable product**. Confirm your decision.

   .. warning::

       You won't be able to turn a configurable product back into a simple one, unless you restore the database from a backup or re-create the product and its option combinations manually.

       :alt: Click "Convert to configurable product" to replace option combinations with product variations.

   After that a simple product will become configurable. The option combinations of that product will turn into variations automatically, with the :doc:`allowed and forbidden option combinations </user_guide/manage_products/options/exceptions>` of the product being considered:

   * If a product has allowed combinations, then variations will be generated only from these combinations.

   * If a product has forbidden combinations, then variations won't be generated from these combinations.
