.. important::

	The certain coupon codes are displayed instead of the **No data found** phrase if there are any coupon codes generated in your store. There should be the **Give coupon** bonus set up for some promotion and there should be the order for which this promotion was applied.

For the example described, if a customer orders over the desired order total (e.g. 90) he/she will get the coupon code, it will be displayed at the bottom of the **Order info** page in the **Promotions** section after an order is placed and if he/she opens the **Conditions** tab of the first promotion after that, there will be a coupon code next to the **Automatically generated coupon codes** phrase.
