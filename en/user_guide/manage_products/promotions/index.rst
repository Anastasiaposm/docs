A list of all promotions in your store appears on a special page (``index.php?dispatch=promotions.list``).

Types of Promotions
===================

CS-Cart supports two types of promotions:

* **Catalog promotions** allow you to set discounts on products and categories, and to specify conditions for those discounts. These discounts are displayed right in the catalog: on product and category pages.

* **Cart promotions** allow you to set discounts and offer various bonuses: coupons, free shipping, free products, reward points, membership in a specific user group, etc. The list of possible conditions for those bonuses is bigger. The bonuses aren't displayed in the catalog, but only on cart and checkout pages.
