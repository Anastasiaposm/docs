#. Switch to the **Bonuses** tab and click the **Add bonus** button.

#. Select the **Product discount** bonus from the dropdown list. Choose how the discount will be applied and enter the size of the discount. For example, let's enter *20*. Here's the various ways of how the discount will work in that case:

   * **To percentage of the original price**: the eligible products will cost 20% of their original price.

   * **By percentage of the original price**: the eligible products will cost 80% of their original price (price with discount = original price - 20%).

   * **To fixed amount**: the price of the eligible products will be set to 20 units of the primary currency of your store, unless those products already have lower prices.

   * **By fixed amount**: the price of the eligible products will be lower by 20 units of the primary currency of your store (price with discount = original price - 20).
