********************************************************

.. note:: 

    **Tutorial Difficulty: 1 / 3**

You can offer free shipping if a customer buys a certain product. This is done via a :doc:`cart promotion <../../manage_products/promotions/index>`. 

.. warning::

    If the free shipping promotion applies to an order, customers won't be charged for shipping any products in that order. Additional shipping charges that you specify for individual products won't apply either.

1. Go to **Marketing â†’ Promotions**.

2. Click the **+** button in the top right corner and choose **Add cart promotion**.

3. Name your promotion and make sure that **Status** is set to *Active*.

.. hint::

    On **General** tab you can add descriptions and choose the time period when this promotion applies. If you tick the **Stop other rules** checkbox, then all other promotions of the same type (catalogue promotions in our case) with lower priority won't apply.

7. Click **Add products and close**.

.. hint::

   If you want the promotion to apply only when a customer buys several different products, add those products as separate conditions. Make sure that the phrase above says **If all of these conditions are true**.
