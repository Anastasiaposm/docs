How To: Offer Free Shipping for Buying a Certain Product
********************************************************

You can offer free shipping when customer has a certain product in cart. This is done via a :doc:`cart promotion <index>`. 

.. warning::

    If the free shipping promotion applies to an order, customers won't be charged for shipping any products in that order. Additional shipping charges that you specify for individual products won't apply either.

To create this promotion, follow the steps below:

#. In the Administration panel, go to **Marketing â†’ Promotions**.

#. Click the **+** button in the top right corner and choose **Add cart promotion**.

#. Tick the checkboxes of one or multiple products from the list. A customer will have to add any of them to cart to be eligible for the promotion.

#. Click **Add products and close**.

   .. hint::

       If you want the promotion to apply only when a customer buys several different products, add those products as separate conditions. Make sure that the phrase above the list of conditions says ``If all of these conditions are true``.
