*   On the opened page, click the **+** button.

Also, in **Settings → General** you can find the **Exception style** setting that allows regulating exception behavior.

By default, the setting is set to *Hide exception*. This means that the defined unavailable option combinations will be removed from the product options when they are displayed in the storefront. Another value of the **Exception style** setting is *Show warning on exception*. This means that all variants of product options will be displayed, but if a customer selects unavailable option combination, he will see the *Unfortunately this combination is not accessible* notification.
