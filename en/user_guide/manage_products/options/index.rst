Options
*******

Options are additional *separable* product properties. That don't have a quantity of their own, and don't affect the quantity of product in stock. But they can affect the price or weight of the product. Good examples of options are:

* Custom engraving

* Gift wrap

* Extended warranty

The **Products â†’ Options** page allows you to manage all product options and option variants in your store. The changes you make here will affect all products that use these options.

* To add a new option, click the **+** button.

* To apply existing options to specific products, click the **Apply to products** button.

* To edit or delete an option, hover the mouse pointer over the option, click the **gear** button, and choose the action from the drop-down list.

* To make an option *Active* or *Disabled*, use the drop-down list to the right. 

  .. hint::

      Sometimes it is useful to disable options temporarily, instead of deleting them.
