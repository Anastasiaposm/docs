The **Products â†’ Options** page allows you to manage global product options and option variants in your store. Global options work in the same manner as the product-specific options, but they can apply to multiple products.

* To add a new option, click the **+** button.

* To apply existing options to specific products, click the **Apply to products** button.

* To edit or delete an option, hover the mouse pointer over the option, click the **gear** button, and choose the action from the drop-down list.

* To make an option *Active* or *Disabled*, use the drop-down list to the right. 

  .. hint::

      Sometimes it is useful to disable options temporarily, instead of deleting them.
