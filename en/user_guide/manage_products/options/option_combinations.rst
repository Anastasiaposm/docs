Product Option Combinations
***************************

.. warning::

    This article is no longer relevant, because option combinations are deprecated. They might exist in your store only if you upgraded from a previous version that had them. To track inventory for similar products and let customers switch between them easily, please use :doc:`product variations </user_guide/manage_products/products/product_variations>`.

To make inventory tracking easier, you can group different combinations of :doc:`product option variants <product_options>` under **option combinations**. For example, clothes come in various colors and sizes. Option combinations allow you to track separately, how many *blue XL-sized T-shirts* and *white M-sized T-shirts* you have. 

.. note::

    Only *Check box*, *Select box*, and *Radio group* options that have the **Inventory** checkbox ticked can be a part of a combination.
