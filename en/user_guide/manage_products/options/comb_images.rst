The image can be either uploaded from a local computer or the server file system, or linked to a remote location where the required image is physically located. An alternative text describes the image and is shown when the image is missing or cannot be displayed. It is good practice to have an alternative text associated with the image as an additional SEO-wise opportunity.

	The image added to the product option combination will be displayed when a customer selects this option combination in the storefront.
