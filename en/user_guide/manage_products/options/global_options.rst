#. In the admin panel, go to **Products â†’ Options**.

   .. note::

       If you haven't :doc:`created a product option yet </user_guide/manage_products/options/product_options>`, you'll be able to do it here as well.

#. Click the gear button in the upper right part of the page and choose **Apply to products**. This will open a new page where you'll be able to select which options to apply, and to which products.
