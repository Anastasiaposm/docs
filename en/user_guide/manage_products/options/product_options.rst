How To: Create a Product Option
*******************************

This article describes how to create an option for a particular product. Afterwards, you'll be able to :doc:`assign this option to other products in bulk </user_guide/manage_products/options/global_options>`.

#. In the admin panel, go to **Products → Products**.

#. Open the product editing page and then switch to the **Options** tab.

#. Сlick the **Add option** button.

   .. hint::

       If you've already created this option for another product, link that existing option instead of creating a new one. If some variants of an option aren't applicable for the product, then exclude those variants via :doc:`allowed or forbidden combinations </user_guide/manage_products/options/exceptions>`.

#. Specify :doc:`option properties </user_guide/manage_products/options/option_attributes>` as you see fit.

#. Click **Create**.
