How To: Sort Products in a Category by Position
***********************************************

By default, products in categories are sorted by alphabet. However, you can change the order in which the products appear in categories. To do that, you'll need to specify positions for products.

#. In the Administration panel, go to **Products → Categories**.

#. Each category has the **Products** column that displays the number of products in that category. Click on the number in the category where you'd like to sort products.

#. A new page with the list of products will open. Specify the positions for products.

#. Click the **Save** button in the upper right part of the page.

   .. important::

       The defined positions affect sorting only if the *Sort by Position: Low To High* or *Sort by Position: High To Low* sorting is selected for the product list page on the storefront.

   You can make *Sort by Position: Low To High* or *Sort by Position: High To Low* the default sorting that will be used when a visitor opens a category page. To do it, go to **Settings → Appearance** and choose this sorting from the  **Product list default sorting** drop-down list. Make sure that these sortings are selected as the **Available product list sortings**.
