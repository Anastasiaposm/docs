Data Feeds
**********

This add-on enables store administrator to create and export any number of custom product feeds of different formats. This functionality is useful when working with shopping directories like Google Product Search, Shopzilla, Shopping.com, etc. as you can adjust the set of fields and their orders according to the required export format.

Feeds can be regularly generated and uploaded to an FTP server or a web directory automatically. This task is controlled by a cron script. You can define your password to access the cron script on the **Data feeds** add-on editing page in the **Add-ons â†’ Manage add-ons** section.

.. note ::

	In CS-Cart, you can create separate data feeds for each store. To do so, switch to the store administrator mode before creating a data feed.
