The :doc:`/user_guide/addons/google_export/index` add-on adds a pre-defined data feed template to the store. This template links CS-Cart product fields to those required by Google. You can customize the mapping rules by linking more fields or removing the existing fields.

This pre-defined template is suitable for regular products from a US supplier. If your products require more fields, or you are from a different country, you need to create a new template.

A complete specification of product fields supported by Google is available `here <http://support.google.com/merchants/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=188494>`_.

If some necessary product fields are missing in CS-Cart, add them as product features. See the :doc:`Features </user_guide/manage_products/features/index>` section for more details.
