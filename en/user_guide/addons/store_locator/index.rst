Store Locator
*************

This add-on allows you to locate your brick-n-mortar stores on Google Maps. Maps with marked locations can then appear on the storefront so that customers can find a nearest point of sale. Locations are managed in **Add-ons → Store locator**.

Settings
********

To manage the following settings, go to the **Add-ons → Manage add-ons** section, find the **Store locator** add-on, and clock on its name.

* **API key**—your Google Maps API key. For details, please refer to the official Google `help page <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#key>`_.

  .. note::

     Please make sure that the *Google Maps JavaScript API* is enabled under APIs in the **Google API Console**. 

* **Map zoom**—the initial resolution at which to display the map, where zoom 0 corresponds to a map of the Earth fully zoomed out, and higher zoom levels zoom in at a higher resolution.

* **Zoom control**—display a slider (for large maps) or small "+/-" buttons (for small maps) to control the zoom level of the map.

* **MapType control**—let the user toggle between map types (such as ROADMAP and SATELLITE).

* **Scale control**—display a map scale element.
