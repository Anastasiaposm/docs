***************************************
How To: Set up the Google Export Add-on
***************************************

.. important ::

	The `Data feeds <http://docs.cs-cart.com/4.4.x/user_guide/addons/data_feeds/index.html>`_ add-on should be installed first because a dependence on the Data feeds add-on is set for Google Export.

*	In the administration panel, go to **Add-ons â†’ Manage add-ons**.
*	Switch to the **Browse all avaible add-ons** tab and find the **Google export** add-on.
*	Click the **Install** button.
*	If you have this add-on installed, go to the **Installed add-ons** tab, click the gear button of the add-on, and choose **Settings**:

	*	**Install additional languages for Google categories** - Tick this checkbox if you need multi-language Google categories installed. Supports French, German, Italian, Spanish, and British English. Pay attention that this operation can take a significant amount of time.

.. note ::

	The Google Export add-on creates demo feed in the Data feed add-on that can be used as an example of creating your own feed and exporting it to Google.
