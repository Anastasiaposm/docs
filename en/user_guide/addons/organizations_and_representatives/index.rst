       You can customize the fields that a customer must fill in about their organization. To edit the registration page, go to **Administration → Profile fields** and switch to **Organization information**.

#. After registration, the customer will become the owner of the organization. An owner can create representatives — other customers that can view and place orders on behalf of the organization.

#. A representative can work with all orders on behalf of the organization. The owner can create or delete representatives and change the organization details.
