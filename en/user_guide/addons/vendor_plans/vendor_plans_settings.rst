*****************************************
How To: Configure the Vendor Plans Add-on
*****************************************

.. note::

    The **Vendor Plans** add-on is installed by default.

#. In the Administration panel, go to **Add-ons → Manage add-ons**.

#. Find the **Vendor Plans** add-on and click on its name.

#. Configure the add-on’s settings:

   * **Include shipping cost in vendor commissions**—if you enable this setting, shipping will be done at the expense of the vendors.
   
   * **Include taxes in vendor commissions**—if you enable this setting, vendor commissions will be calculated without subtracting taxes from the order total beforehand.

   * **Allow vendors to change their current plan**—if you tick this checkbox, vendors will be able to :ref:`move to another plan by themselves. <switch-between-vendor-plans>` Otherwise vendors simply won’t see other plans when they edit their profiles.

     .. important::

         Those who :doc:`apply for a vendor account </user_guide/users/vendors/allow_customers_to_apply_for_vendor_account>` will still see all the active plans that exist in your store.

#. Click **Save** to apply your changes.
