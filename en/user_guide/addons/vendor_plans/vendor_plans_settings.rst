*****************************************
How To: Configure the Vendor Plans Add-on
*****************************************

.. note::

    This article applies only to **Multi-Vendor 4.4.1** and newer versions. The **Vendor Plans** add-on is installed by default.

1. In the Administration panel, go to **Add-ons → Manage add-ons**.

2. Find the **Vendor Plans** add-on and click on its name.

3. Configure the add-on’s settings:

   * **Include shipping cost in vendors commission**—if you tick this checkbox, shipping will be done at the expense of the vendors.
  
   * **Take payment surcharge from vendors**—if you tick this checkbox, a customer won’t see payment surcharge; payment surcharges won’t be applied to the order total.

   * **Allow vendors to change their current plan**—if you tick this checkbox, vendors will be able to :ref:`move to another plan by themselves. <switch-between-vendor-plans>` Otherwise vendors simply won’t see other plans when they edit their profiles.

.. important::

    Those who :doc:`apply for a vendor account <../../users/vendors/allow_customers_to_apply_for_vendor_account>` will still see all the active plans that exist in your store.

4. Click **Save** to apply your changes.
