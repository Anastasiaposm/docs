How To: Set up Product Price in Points According to Ratio
*********************************************************

To configure the **Reward Points** add-on, complete the following steps:

1. Open the administration panel of your store. 

2. Go to **Add-ons → Manage add-ons**.

3. Click on the name of the **Reward points** add-on.

4. Enter the number of reward points in the **Points Exchange Rate (PER - the number of points equal to 1 conventional unit)** input field.

    The price in points is always rounded to the next highest integer. With point exchange ratio set to 1 it would take 7 points to fully cover a $6.99 or a $6.33 order.

6. Go to **Products → Products**.

7. Click on the name of the product.

8. Open the **Reward points** tab.
