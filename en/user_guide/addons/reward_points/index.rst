Reward Points
*************

This add-on enables a point-based bonus program in your store. In such a program, customers are rewarded with a certain amount of bonus points for purchasing a product. They receive these points for their accounts and can later use them to pay for other products or just reduce the original cost of products if the existing amount of points does not cover it completely.

Points can be granted for purchasing a specific product or any product from a category. The amount of points given can depend on a membership level: members of different user groups can get different amounts of points for purchasing the same product.

The ability to pay for a product with points is defined individually for each product. A product's price in points may be calculated automatically depending on the global settings or be set up individually for each product. The amount of points earned for buying the product can be inherited from the category settings or be specific to that product only. All individual values are set up on the **Reward points** tab of the product editing page.
