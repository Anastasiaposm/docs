Functionality
=============

This add-on allows administrator or the marketplace owner to:

* grant points for purchasing a specific product or any product from a category;

* set the amount of points given depending on a membership level: members of different user groups can get different amounts of points for purchasing the same product;

* decide whether to allow payment by points for this or that product.

  A product's price in points may be calculated automatically depending on the global settings or be set up individually for each product. The amount of points earned for buying the product can be inherited from the category settings or be specific to that product only. All individual values are set up on the **Reward points** tab of the product editing page.

The add-on allows customers to:

* receive a certain amount of bonus points for purchasing a product;

* use points to pay for other products or just reduce the original cost of products if the existing amount of points does not cover it completely.

  If the buyer wants to use **reward points** then at checkout he or she should enter the desired amount of points in the field. The order total will decrease according to points exchange rate. The rest of the sum can be paid via any available payment method.
