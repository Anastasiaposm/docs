  * Click on the customers' name to open his/her profile and open the **User groups** tab.

  * Check whether the necessary user group has the *Active* status.

* Check whether the order has :doc:`a status that grants reward points. <../../orders/order_statuses/set_status>`:

  * Go to **Orders → View orders**.

  * Check the order status in the **Status** select box. Change the status if necessary.
