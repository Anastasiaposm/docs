****************************************************
How To: Grant Reward Points for Orders Automatically
****************************************************

#. In the Administration panel, go to **Add-ons → Manage add-ons** and :doc:`set up the Reward Points add-on </user_guide/addons/reward_points/set_rp_addon>`.

#. Go to **Marketing → Reward points**.

#. Configure the amount of reward points granted per product to members of different user groups.

   The amount of granted reward points also depends on the **Amount type** column:

   * *Percent (%)*—the number of points to be received by a customer will be calculated depending on the product prices (not on the order total). 

   * *Absolute (points)*—the fixed number of points per product will be added to a customer account, regardless of the cost of purchased products.

#. Click the **Save** button.
