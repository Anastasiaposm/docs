Watermarks
**********

A watermark is a text or graphic overlay (usually, a transparent one) that is added to images. For example, this can be a company name or a logo.

Watermarks not only add more identity to product and category images in your store, but they also protect images from unauthorized commercial use by other companies and private individuals.

By using this add-on, you can define a common watermark for your store images. Then, CS-Cart will automatically add the specified watermark to all necessary images and thumbnails in the product catalog.
