*********************************
SEO Add-on: Technical Information
*********************************

* **SEO name** is a unique part of the full URL. In other words, there can be two products with the same **SEO name**, but in different categories. For example, *men/shoes, women/shoes*. If the **SEO name** already exists, when creating the identical one the index will be added.

----

* Changing **SEO name** automatically creates a redirect from old URL. You can disable it by unticking the checkbox **Create redirect from old URL** that appears when you edit the **SEO name**.

----

* The add-on directs search engines to index pages. The list of pages for each object is available at the ``seo/schemas/objects.php`` schema.

----

* The add-on generates canonical URLs for products (a product page—canonical) and categories (a list of products with pagination—canonical, prev, next).

----

* Add-on information of the individual product is displayed at the **SEO** tab.

----

* The add-on generates meta-tags of a product page for Google Rich Snippets (based on `schema.org <http://schema.org/>`_). The preview of the snippet is displayed at the **SEO** tab.

----

* The add-on provides correct redirects (status *301*) for alterable URLs, such as *index.php*, *index.php?dispatch=products.view&product_id=12*, etc.

----

* Generating rules for different URLs are described in the ``seo/schemas/objects.php`` schema.
