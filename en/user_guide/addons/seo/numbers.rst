*********************************
If Numbers Are Added to SEO Names
*********************************

The number is added to a SEO name if the same name is already in use for another object (product, category, etc). This was created so that if the administrator gives the same name for two categories (products, manufacturers, etc), CS-Cart adds **1** to SEO name of the second category automatically. For example, if the administrator gives the SEO name **Books** to a category Ð°nd then gives the same name to another one, CS-Cart adds **1** to the second one. And after that, the first category will have the **Books** name and the second one will have the **Books1** name. If the administrator gives the SEO name **Books** to one more category CS-Cart adds **1-2** to the SEO name of this category and so on.

.. note ::

	This rule covers all SEO names.
