    The up-to-date information about canonical URLs is now located :doc:`in another article </user_guide/addons/seo/index>`.

To make you site better understood by search engines, **canonical URLs** for categories and products are generated in CS-Cart.

If some URL is marked as the canonical, search engine robot understands that this is the original content URL and there is no need to index its duplicates. The example is the same page with products or categories list, but with different sortings. There is no need to index all these page variants, and using canonical URLs is very useful here.

Such URLs are formed automatically.
