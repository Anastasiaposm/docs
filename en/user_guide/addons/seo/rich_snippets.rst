**Rich snippet** is a markup easily understood by search engines that base on this markup when displaying additional data in search results.

In CS-Cart rich snippets for product pages are generated automatically. To check the rich snippet for particular product, do the following:

*   In the Administration panel, go to **Products â†’ Products**.
*   Choose a product and open its editing page by clicking on the product name.
*   On the opened page choose the **SEO** tab.

You can see the rich snippet at the bottom of the page in the **Google rich snippets preview** section. The snippet contents are formed based on some product information such as description and price.
