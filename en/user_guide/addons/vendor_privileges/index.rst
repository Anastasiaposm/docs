Vendor Privileges
*****************

.. note::

    This add-on first appeared in version 4.9.1. It is available only in Multi-Vendor Plus and Ultimate.

=============
Functionality
=============

The **Vendor Privileges** add-on allows you to :doc:`manage user groups for vendors' administrators </user_guide/users/vendors/vendor_group>`: create and assign those groups, manage their privileges, and set the default user group for all new vendors.

============
Installation
============

The **Vendor Privileges** add-on is installed :doc:`like any other add-on </user_guide/addons/1manage_addons>`. Once you do it, click the add-on's name to open its settings. The add-on has only one setting:

* **Default user group for vendors' administrators**â€”this setting automatically assigns all newly-created vendor administrators to the user group of your choice. That way you can create a default set of privileges that all your vendors will get.

  .. important::

      Changing this setting won't affect the vendors' administrators that already exist in your marketplace.
