#. Automatic detection of the customer's city, and the ability to for the customer to choose a different city via the **Customer location** :doc:`block </user_guide/look_and_feel/layouts/blocks/index>`. The determined or selected city (along with country and state) will be used at checkout.

=============
Configuration
=============

The **Maps and Geolocation** add-on is installed :doc:`like any other add-on </user_guide/addons/1manage_addons>`. Once the add-on is installed, click the add-onâ€™s name to open its settings:

* **Provider** determines the third-party service that your store uses for maps and geolocation:

  * **Google** is selected by default. However, for maps and geolocation to work, you'll need to set up an API key at the Google website. Go to the `Google Maps Platform <https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/>`_ page, select projects **Maps** and **Places**, and then follow the instructions at the page.

    .. note::

        There is also another way: go directly to `Google Developers Console <https://console.developers.google.com>`_ and manually enable *Geocoding API*, *Places API*, *Maps JavaScript API*, *Geolocation API*, and *Maps Static API*. In this case you'll need to manually set up billing for your project (for example, link a credit card), or else the map won't work.

  * **Yandex** can be chosen instead of Google. It won't require an API key, unless you use `the paid version of the API <https://tech.yandex.com/maps/commercial/>`_.

  When you get an API key, just add it to the corresponding tab of the add-on's settings and save the changes.

* **Show shipping cost and time on product pages** does what it says: if you enable it, product pages will contain the time and rate estimations for the shipping methods available for the customer's location.
