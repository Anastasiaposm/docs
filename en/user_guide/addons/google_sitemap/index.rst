Google Sitemap

This add-on generates an XML sitemap of your web store, which is adapted to be easily parsed and understood by web crawlers. It makes website indexing easier and more qualitative. This improves the standing of your web store among popular search engines, including Google, Yahoo, and MSN/Bing. Having an XML sitemap is highly recommended if you run a large store with a significant number of products and categories in the catalog.

The add-on allows you to configure options of each web store element that can be described in the sitemap: homepage, product pages, category pages, content pages, news, and extended feature pages.

The **Google sitemap** has the following settings:

* **Include in sitemap**—if selected, the component is included in the sitemap.

* **Update frequency**—time interval between two updates of an element.

* **Priority**—priority of the element relatively to the other elements.
