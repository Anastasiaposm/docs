.. note ::

	The official Searchanise documentation is available at `searchanise.com <http://docs.searchanise.com/dev/>`_.

The **Searchanise** add-on integrates CS-Cart with the SaaS-solution of the same name. It adds enhanced instant product search to the storefront by replacing its regular search bar with a special search widget. Shoppers see search results as they type in the search bar, and can quickly review the found products. So, customers can get to the right product way much faster because they donâ€™t even have to finish typing while the preview box forms the first impression of the product.

Searchanise can search through products, categories and pages (i.e., blog posts) in your store.

.. note::

   Searchanise can find products by product code, name, description, features, and option combination codes.

.. important ::

	Searchanise is incompatible with the `Age Verification <http://docs.cs-cart.com/4.4.x/user_guide/addons/age_verification/index.html>`_ add-on because this add-on controls access to products on the category level while Searchanise processes store data on the product level and takes no account of categories and their properties.

 

With the Searchanise panel you can navigate through the Searchanise sections that are described separately further in this guide.
