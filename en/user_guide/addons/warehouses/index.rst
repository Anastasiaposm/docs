.. note::

    This add-on first appeared in version 4.11.1. It is available only in CS-Cart Ultimate and Multi-Vendor Ultimate.

This add-on extends :doc:`Stores and Pickup Points </user_guide/addons/stores_and_pickup_points/index>`, allowing you to:

* Set different product quantities at different places (stores and warehouses).

* Export and import product quantities at different places separately.

* Show the quantities of a product at different places to customers.

* Set which warehouses deliver products to what region.

* Set the order of stores and warehouses for each region, so that product quantity would decrease at the correct warehouse first.

* Warn customers about a delay if a product needs to be shipped from a remote location or a supplier.
