Google reCAPTCHA
****************

The **Google reCAPTCHA** add-on provides anti-bot protection without making it complicated for humans to navigate and use the store. 

In most cases, your customers simply have to tick the "I'm not a robot" checkbox to confirm that they're humans. If the algorithm has reasons to supspect that a customer is a bot, then the customer will be asked to solve a CAPTCHA.

.. important::

    Starting with version 4.5.1, Google reCAPTCHA is the only default anti-bot protection mechanism. The old CAPTCHA (:doc:`Settings â†’ Image verification </user_guide/look_and_feel/changing_attributes/image_verification>`) was removed.
