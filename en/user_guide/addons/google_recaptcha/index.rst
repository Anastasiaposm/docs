.. note::

    This add-on first appeared in CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor 4.4.3. If you have an earlier version, please use one of the `third-party Google reCAPTCHA add-ons from our Marketplace <http://marketplace.cs-cart.com/?subcats=Y&status=A&pshort=Y&pfull=Y&pname=Y&pkeywords=Y&search_performed=Y&cid=88&q=google+recaptcha&dispatch=products.search&sl=en>`_ instead.

The **Google reCAPTCHA** add-on provides anti-bot protection without making it complicated for humans to navigate and use the store. 

In most cases, your customers simply have to tick the "I'm not a robot" checkbox to confirm that they're humans. If the algorithm has reasons to supspect that a customer is a bot, then the customer will be asked to solve a CAPTCHA.

If you configure and use this add-on in CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor 4.4.3, then Google's reCAPTCHA will replace the old :doc:`image verification </user_guide/look_and_feel/changing_attributes/image_verification>` mechanism.
