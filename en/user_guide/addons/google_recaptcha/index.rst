Google reCAPTCHA
****************
    
The **Google reCAPTCHA** add-on provides anti-bot protection without making it complicated for humans to navigate and use the store.

The add-on supports two reCAPTCHA versions:

* **reCAPTCHA v2: Checkbox** uses physical verification in the form of tests. In most cases, your customers simply have to tick the "I'm not a robot" checkbox to confirm that they're humans. 

  If the algorithm has reasons to supspect that a customer is a bot, then the customer will be asked to solve a CAPTCHA.

* **reCAPTCHA v3** is invisible for customers and protects your store by working in the background. The add-on supports *reCAPTCHA v3* starting with version 4.12.1 of CS-Cart and Multi-Vendor.

  .. important::
  
      You can use both reCAPTCHA versions at the same time in the different places of your store, or you can use just one versionâ€”in this case you only have to configure it.
