       :alt: Find and install the "Ask seller a question" add-on.

#. Click on the name of the add-on to access its settings. Configure them as you see fit:

   * **Contact button on product pages**—if you enable this setting, the *Ask a question* button will appear on product pages. In CS-Cart, the messages will go to store administration, and in Multi-Vendor they will go to vendors.

   * **Contact button at "Messages" menu** (*only in CS-Cart*)—if you enable this setting, the *Ask a question* button will appear on the **My Account → Messages** page on the storefront.

   * **Contact button in vendor microstore** (*only in Multi-Vendor*)—if you enable this setting, the *Ask a question* button will appear in vendors' microstores.

     .. note::

         This setting will only affect those vendors who have a :doc:`vendor plan </user_guide/users/vendors/manage_vendor_plans>` with vendor microstores.

#. Once you configure the add-on, click **Save**. After that you should see the *Ask a question* button on the pages that you specified in the settings of the add-on.
