The Message center add-on helps to establish communication between CS-Cart users.  This is a necessary solution if you want to give your customers ability to:

* ask a question about a product;

* communicate with you or your vendors (if you are a marketplace owner).

The add-on can also help the marketplace owner to communicate with his vendors.

Communication with Customers
============================

The Message center add-on provides vendors and marketplace owners with the ability to answer customers in time. On the **Customers → Message center** page vendors or marketplace owners can:

* read customers' messages;

* answer those messages, including customers' questions on specific products. A link to the product page from which the question has been sent is attached at the bottom of the dialog. This allows the vendor to go to the product page right away, and quickly solve the client's problem or answer his question.

The add-on allows customers to:

* ask a question right from the storefront via the **Ask a question** button.

* read and answer messages on the **Messages** tab in their accounts.

Communication between Vendors and Administrators
================================================

The Message center add-on allows vendors and marketplace owners to communicate with each other on the **Vendors → Message center** page. This is useful in case if:

* the vendor has a question to the administrator;

* the admin has any comments or suggestions on how the product in the vendor's store should be filled, and he wants to show him what needs to be fixed;

* the marketplace owner wants to tell his vendors some important news.
