Ask Seller a Question
*********************

The **Ask Seller a Question** add-on allows customers to contact administrators (in CS-Cart) or vendors (in Multi-Vendor) directly from the storefront. Here is how it works: 

* A customer signs in to his or her account and initiates the communication by using the "Ask a question" button.

* Administrators or vendor's administrators see the message in the admin panel and can reply to it. Chains of messages and their replies are grouped into threads.

* Depending on the settings in **Administration â†’ Notifications**, customers, admins, and vendors receive notifications about new messages.

  .. note::

      Email notifications will be sent only if you use :doc:`the new email template editing mode </user_guide/look_and_feel/email_templates/enable_email_editor>`.

* The customer can check the message history and continue the conversation in his or her account on the storefront.
