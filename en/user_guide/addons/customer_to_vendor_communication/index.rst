********************************
Customer-to-Vendor Communication
********************************

.. important::

    This add-on exists only in Multi-Vendor 4.7.1 and newer versions.

The **Customer-to-Vendor Communication** add-on allows customers to contact vendors directly from the storefront. Here is how it works: 

* A customer signs in to his or her account and initiates the communication by contacting a vendor from a product page or the microstore of that vendor.

* The contacted vendor sees the message in the Administration panel and can reply to it. Chains of messages and their replies are grouped into threads.
 
* Notifications are sent to the customer's and/or vendor's email address to inform them about new messages (that depends on the add-on's settings).

* The customer can check the message history and continue the conversation in his or her account on the storefront.
