eBay-related Category Settings

.. important::

      This article only applies to **CS-Cart 4.3.5** and higher. It also works for those, who upgraded to the new version of the eBay Synchronization add-on via an upgrade package for **CS-Cart 4.3.4**.

To edit the eBay properties of a category, go to **Products → Categories** and click the category you want to edit. Then switch to the **eBay** tab.

Here you can choose how to assign a corresponding eBay category to the products you export to eBay. You can either use the category of the eBay template that you apply to the products, or assign a different eBay category manually.

.. important::

    An eBay template can only have one assigned eBay category. The secondary eBay category fields `serve a different purpose <http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/two-categories.html>`_. But you can **assign a corresponding eBay category to a category of your store to override the template’s settings**.

For example, you want to export cell phones and golf clubs from your store to eBay. The shipping and payment methods are the same. Then you have 2 options:

*  Make 2 separate eBay templates for golf clubs and cell phones

*  Use one eBay template with Golf Clubs as its eBay Category, but manually choose Cell Phones eBay category for the Cell Phones category of your store.

A store usually sells many different items, which in turn may fall under many different eBay categories. That’s when the option to override your eBay template’s category may come in handy.
