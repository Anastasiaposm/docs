You have just :doc:`installed, activated, and configured the new eBay Synchronization add-on <ebay_install>`. The first thing you’ll notice is that the menu has changed. There is now a new subsection of the **Marketing** menu called **eBay**.

* **eBay** or **eBay templates** will take you to the list of your eBay templates

* **eBay logs** will take you to the log page with eBay export history and errors encountered during the export of your products to eBay

* **eBay products** will take you to the list of products that have an assigned eBay template

But that’s not all! You’ll see a new **eBay** tab under **Products → Products → <Desired product>** and **Products → Categories → <Desired Category>**. On those tabs you’ll find various eBay-associated parameters for products and categories.
