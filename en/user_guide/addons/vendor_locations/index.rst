Vendor Locations [Beta]
***********************

.. note::

    This add-on is exclusive in Multi-Vendor and first appeared in version 4.8.1.

The **Vendor locations [Beta]** add-on helps customers make a more informed buying decision. For that purpose, the add-on provides several tools:

#. A map with all the vendors displayed on it.

#. A filter that forces the map to display vendors only from the specified city.

#. A list of nearby vendors.

#. A product filter by distance from the customer's location.

#. The ability for a customer to enter the desired location, so that the product filter and the list of nearby vendors would work.
