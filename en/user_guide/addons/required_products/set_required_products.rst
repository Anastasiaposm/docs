How To: Set up the Required Products Add-on
*******************************************

To set up the **Required products** add-on:

*   In the Administration panel, go to **Add-ons → Manage add-ons**.
*   Enable the **Required products** add-on (change its status to *Active*).

To add the required products for a product:

*   Go to **Products → Products**.
*   Click on the product for which you want to add required products.
*   Choose the **Required products** tab.
*   Click the **Add products** button. In the opened window choose the products and click **Add products and close**.
*   Click **Save** to save the changes.


If a customer adds the main product to the cart and there are no required products of this product in it, CS-Cart will add all the missing ones automatically. If a customer deletes one of the required products from the cart, CS-Cart will delete the main one automatically as well.

.. note ::

	Required products are not dependent on the main product quantity. So, if there is at least one required product in the cart, a purchase will be processed successfully.

To add the suggested products, follow the instructions `here <http://docs.cs-cart.com/4.4.x/user_guide/look_and_feel/layouts/blocks/related_products.html>`_.
