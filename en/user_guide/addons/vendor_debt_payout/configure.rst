************************************************* 
How To: Configure Vendor-to-Admin Payments Add-on
*************************************************

.. important::

    This add-on replaced the Vendor Debt Payout add-on in Multi-Vendor 4.12.1.

Install the Vendor-to-Admin Payments add-on :doc:`just like any other add-on </user_guide/addons/1manage_addons>`. After the installation, click on the add-on name to open its settings. Here you can do the following:

* Decide when a vendor becomes a debtor. By default, these rules are global and apply to if you want to set the same conditions for all your vendors, or set individual values for different vendor plans.

  .. note::

      If you want to set different values for the minimum allowed balance and grace period for different vendor plans, click the button next to the balance and grace period settings. This way you will change the global settings to individual.

* Decide what restrictions to apply to suspended vendors: hide their products and/or block their admin panels.

* Decide whether to completely disable accounts of those vendors who don't pay their debts for a long time (and when to disable them).

* See what notifications the add-on has, and edit them.
