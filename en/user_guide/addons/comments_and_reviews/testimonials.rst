===================================================
Display a Block with Testimonials on the Storefront
===================================================

If you want your customers to see or give testimonials, you'll need to :doc:`add a new block to the storefront </user_guide/look_and_feel/layouts/blocks/actions_on_blocks>` (for example, to the homepage). Choose the block that is called **Testimonials**.

.. note::

    Once you have added the block, you can click its gear icon to see more settings. Whenever you add a block or change its settings, it's always a good idea to check how the block looks on the storefront.
