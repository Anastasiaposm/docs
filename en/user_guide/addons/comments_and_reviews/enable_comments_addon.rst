**********************************************
How To: Set up the Comments and Reviews Add-on
**********************************************

================
Check the Add-on
================

#. In the Administration panel, go to **Add-ons → Manage add-ons**.

#. Make sure that the **Comments and reviews** add-on is *Active*.

#. (optional) Click the name of the add-on to open its settings. The settings are grouped into tabs, and each tab is responsible for an object type that supports reviews.

   Here are a few examples of what you can do in the add-on settings:

   * Enable pre-moderation for comments, so that only the comments approved by administrators would become visible to other customers.

   * Automatically allow or forbid comments and reviews for newly-created objects without affecting existing ones. That way you won't need to manually do this for every object you create.

   * Forbid to leave reviews about a product or vendor to anyone who hasn't bought that product or from that vendor.

==============================
Choose Where to Allow Comments
==============================

#. Go to the page with the objects for which you'd like to allow comments (for example, **Products → Products** or **Products → Categories**).

   .. note::

       You can allow comments and/or reviews for products, categories, orders, blog, pages, and the store itself (testimonials).

#. Click on the name of the product or category, for which you want to allow comments.

#. Go to the **Add-ons** tab.

#. Choose one of the variants for the *Reviews* property in the **Comments and reviews** section:

   * *Communication and Rating*—customers can write a review and rate the object on the scale from 1 to 5.

   * *Communication*—customers can write a review but can't rate the object.

   * *Rating*—customers can rate the object, but can't write a review.

   * *Disabled*—customers can't write a review or rate the object.

In Multi-Vendor, vendors can not confugure product reviews by default. You can allow them to do it. To do this you need the :doc:`/user_guide/addons/vendor_privileges/index` add-on.

#. Go to **Customers → User groups**.

#. Find the **Vendor** user group and click its name to open the settings.

#. In the **Website** section, find the **Comments and reviews** field and enable the **Full access** setting.

#. Click **Save**.
