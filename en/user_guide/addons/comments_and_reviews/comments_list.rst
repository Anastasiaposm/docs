Viewing Reviews and Comments
****************************

The **Website → Comments and reviews** section contains ratings, comments, reviews, and other customer communications. Here you can manage all feedback and communications in your store.

The section is divided into the following subsections:

* Category reviews

* Page comments

* Order communication

* Testimonials

.. note::

    For the **Comments and reviews** section to appear, install and activate the **Comments and reviews** add-on under **Add-ons → Manage add-ons**.

Before customers can leave their comments, you need to enable comments and/or for respective objects such as categories, and pages on the **Add-ons** tab. For example, to enable ratings and comments for a category, go to **Products → Categories → <Desired Category>**, switch to the **Add-ons** tab and set **Reviews** to *Communication and rating*.

.. important::

    Starting with version 4.9.1, you can enable comments or reviews for newly-created objects (such as categories) by default and without affecting existing objects. This is done in the settings of the **Comments and reviews** add-on.
