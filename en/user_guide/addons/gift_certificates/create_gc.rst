How To: Create Gift Certificate in Administration Panel
*******************************************************

#. In the Administration panel, go to **Marketing → Gift certificates**.

#. Click the **+** button to add a certificate.

#. The gift certificate creation page will open. Fill in the following fields:

   * **To**—the name of the person who will receive the certificate.

   * **From**—the name of the person who sends the certificate.

   * **Message**—the message that comes with the certificate (a greeting, some wish, etc.)

   * **Amount**—the certificate's worth. Can be either specified as a custom amount or chosen from a fixed set of available amounts.

     .. note::

         The amount must lie within the minimum and maximum amounts that are defined by the :doc:`settings </user_guide/addons/gift_certificates/gc_addon_settings>` of the **Gift certificates** add-on.

   * **Send via email/Send via postal mail**—choose how the certificate should be sent to the recipient. Depending on your choice, you'll have to specify either an email, or a postal address.

   * **Free products**—the products that will be bundled with the certificate. The recipient will be able to add them to cart for free when he or she redeems the certificate's code in your store.

   * **Notify customer**—if you tick this checkbox, the customer will receive an automatic email notification when a new gift certificate is created.

#. Click **Create and close**.
