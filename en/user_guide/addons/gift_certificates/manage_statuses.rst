By default, there are four possible gift certificate statuses:

* **Active**—the certificate can be applied.

* **Disabled**—the certificate has been disabled by the store administrator.

* **Pending**—the certificate was created, but hasn't been activated yet.

* **Used**—the gift certificate has been used, and all the money assigned to that certificate has been spent.

To edit existing statuses, choose the **gear** button, corresponding to a particular status and click **Edit**.

If necessary, you can expand the default set of gift certificate statuses with custom statuses.
