How To: Manage Gift Certificate Statuses
****************************************

==================================
The Gift Certificate Statuses Page
==================================

Every gift certificate has a status assigned to it. To see the list of available statuses, go to **Administration → Gift certificate statuses**.

.. hint::

   You can also go to **Marketing → Gift certificates**, click the gear button in the upper right part of the page, and choose **Gift certificate statuses**.

Here's what you can do on the list of the gift certificate statuses:

* Create a new status by clicking the **+** button.

* Edit an existing status by clicking its name.

* Drag & drop the statuses to sort them.

By default, there are four possible gift certificate statuses:

* **Active**—the certificate can be applied.

* **Disabled**—the certificate has been disabled by the store administrator.

* **Pending**—the certificate was created, but hasn't been activated yet.

* **Used**—the gift certificate has been used, and all the money assigned to that certificate has been spent.
