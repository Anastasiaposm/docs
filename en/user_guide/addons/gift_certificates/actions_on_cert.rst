======================
Add a Gift Certificate
======================

Although gift certificates are supposed to be created and bought by customers, an administrator can also create and modify gift certificates in the Administration panel. Here's how to do it:

#. Go to **Marketing → Gift certificates**.

#. Click the **+** button.

   This will open a form for creating a gift certificate, which is quite similar to the form that customers use to create gift certificates.

#. Fill in the form:

   * **To**—the name of the person who will receive the certificate.

   * **From**—the name of the person who sends the certificate.

   * **Message**—the message that comes with the certificate (a greeting, some wish, etc.)

   * **Amount**—the certificate's worth. Can be either specified as a custom amount or chosen from a fixed set of available amounts.

     .. note::

         The amount must lie within the minimum and maximum amounts that are defined by the :doc:`settings </user_guide/addons/gift_certificates/gc_addon_settings>` of the **Gift certificates** add-on.

   * **Send via email/Send via postal mail**—choose how the certificate should be sent to the recipient. Depending on your choice, you'll have to specify either an email, or a postal address.

   * **Free products**—the products that will be bundled with the certificate. The recipient will be able to add them to cart for free when he or she uses the redeems the certificate's code in your store.

   * **Notify customer**—if you tick this checkbox, the customer will receive an automatic email notification when a new gift certificate is created.
	
#. Click the **Create** button.

=======================
Edit a Gift Certificate
=======================

Administrators can edit details of existing gift certificates. To do it:

#. Go to **Marketing → Gift certificates**.

#. Click on the code of the certificate you want to edit. This will open a form similar to the gift certificate creation form.

#. Edit the fields in the form.

#. Click the **Save** button.

=============================
View Gift Certificate History
=============================

CS-Cart registers all changes in the balance of a gift certificate. To view the history of changes:

#. Go to **Marketing → Gift certificates**.

#. Click on the code of the certificate you're interested in. This will open the page with gift certificate details.

#. Switch to the **History** tab to see the list of changes. Each entry in the list contains the following elements:

   * **Date**—the date and time when the change was made.

   * **Email**—email address of the user who changed the balance.

   * **Order ID**—the ID of the order.

   * **Name**—the name of the user who changed the balance.

   * **Balance**—the certificate's worth before the balance was changed.

   * **Debit balance**—the certificate's worth after the balance was changed.
