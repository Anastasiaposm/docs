RMA
***

RMA stands for return merchandise authorization. This add-on is designed to simplify the process of managing product returns. When it is enabled, customers can register product return requests specifying the reason for the return and providing other related information. Store administrators can then handle requested returns through a special section of the administration panel.

For instructions on how to handle registered product returns, please refer to the section `Orders â†’ Return requests <http://docs.cs-cart.com/4.3.x/user_guide/orders/return_requests/index.html>`_. Return requests are allowed only for products that are marked as returnable. This option together with the return period is controlled separately for each product in the catalog at the product details page.
