How To: Set up a Country as a Rate Area
***************************************

To set up a rate area that covers an entire particular country (for example, Australia):

#. Go to **Administration → Shipping & taxes → Rate areas**.

#. Add a new rate area by clicking the **+** button in the upper right part of the page.

#. Name your rate area (in our example it'd be *Australia*).

#. Tick the **Add in all realtime shipping methods** checkbox if you want the new rate area to be added to all realtime shipping methods that exist in your store.

#. Select *Australia* in the **Countries** section and move it to the left box with the **<** icon.

#. Select all the Australian states and territories (e.g. *Australia: New South Wales* and *Australia: Australian Capital Territory*) in the **States** section on the right side and move them to the left box with the **<** icon.

   .. important::

       You don't have to add the country's states, provinces, or counties from the right box. But if you do add any of them, then those you don't add won't be a part of the rate area.

#. Leave the boxes on the left in other sections empty.

#. Click the **Create** button.
