How To: Set up a Country as a Rate Area
***************************************

To set up a rate area that covers an entire particular country (for example, Australia):

#. Go to **Administration → Shipping & taxes → Rate areas**.

#. Add a new rate area by clicking the **+** button in the upper right part of the page.

#. Name your rate area (in our example it'd be *Australia*).

#. Tick the **Add in all realtime shipping methods** checkbox if you want the new rate area to be added to all realtime shipping methods that exist in your store.

#. Select *Australia* in the **Countries** section and move it to the left box with the **<** icon.

#. Select all the Australian states and territories (e.g. *Australia: New South Wales* and *Australia: Australian Capital Territory*) in the **States** section on the right side and move them to the left box with the **<** icon.

   .. important::

       If a country has states, provinces, or counties in the right box, make sure to add them to the left box. If you add country and one of its administrative territorial entity, then another entities won't be considered a part of this rate area. If a country does not have any administrative territorial entities, leave the left box in the **States** section empty.
	   
	   But if the country has any administrative territorial entities, and the list of **States** on the left is empty, then the delivery calculation will be based on the rate area of the country in which client's **State** is located.

#. Leave the boxes on the left in other sections empty.

#. Click the **Create** button.
