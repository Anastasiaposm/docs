How To: Set up a Country as a Location
**************************************

To set up a location for a particular country (for example, Australia):

#. Go to **Administration → Shipping & taxes → Locations**.

#. Add a new location by clicking the **+** button in the upper right part of the page.

#. Name your location (in our example it'd be *Australia*).

#. Select *Australia* in the **Countries** section and move it to the left box with the **<** icon.

#. Select all the Australian states and territories (e.g. *Australia: New South Wales* and *Australia: Australian Capital Territory*) in the **States** section on the right side and move them to the left box with the **<** icon.

   .. important::

       If a country has states, provinces, or counties in the right box, make sure to add them to the left box. If a country does not have any administrative territorial entities, leave the left box in the **States** section empty.

#. Leave the boxes on the left in other sections empty.

#. Click the **Create** button.
