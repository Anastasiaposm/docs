How To: Set up a Rate Area
**************************

#. Go to **Administration → Shipping & taxes → Locations**.

#. Click the **+** button on the right to add a new rate area.

#. Enter the desired name for your new rate area. Let's set up an area for Maryland, USA, and call it *USA-Maryland*.

#. Select *United States* in the right box in the **Countries** section, then click the **<** icon to move it to the left box.

#. Select *United States: Maryland* in the right box in the **States** section, then click the **<** icon to move it to the left box.

#. Leave the left boxes empty for all other sections.

#. Click the **Create** button.

   .. important::

       If geographic areas (states or countries) of different rate areas intersect each other, then a more precise location will be used for a customer at checkout. For example, if both the *USA + Maryland* and *USA + All states* locations include the customer's address, the first one will be used.
