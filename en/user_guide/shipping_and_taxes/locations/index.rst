Rate Areas
**********

The **Administration → Shipping & taxes → Rate areas** page allows you to control where your store ships to. A *rate area* is a combination of parameters that represent a geographical area. Rate areas are used to calculate shipping rates and tax charges.

.. important::

    If a customer's address doesn't match any existing rate area (or if no shipping methods have rates for the customer's location), then the customer won't be able to select a shipping method at checkout and place an order.

.. hint::

    **Default rate area (all countries)** applies to the customers who don't belong to any existing rate areas in your store. Create a shipping method called *Discuss with manager* and make it free for the default rate area. That way any customer will be able to place an order, unless that customer belongs to a non-default rate area without any shipping rates.
