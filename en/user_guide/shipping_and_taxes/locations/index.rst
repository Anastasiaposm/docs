Locations
*********

The **Administration → Shipping & taxes → Locations** page allows you to manage the locations that your store ships to. A location is a combination of parameters that represent a geographical area. Locations are used to calculate shipping rates and tax charges.

.. important::

    If a customer's address doesn't match any existing location (or if no shipping methods have rates for the customer's location), then the customer won't be able to select a shipping method at checkout and place an order.

.. hint::

    **Default location (all countries)** applies to the customers who don't belong to any existing locations in your store. Create a shipping method called *Discuss with manager* and make it free for the default location. That way any customer will be able to place an order, unless that customer belongs to a non-default location without any shipping rates.
