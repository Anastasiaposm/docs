Ways to Set up Free Shipping
****************************

By default, all the products (other than digital) require shipping. If an order requires shipping, customer must choose a shipping method. This article describes how to make shipping free for customers.

======================================================
Way 1. Exclude Products from Shipping Cost Calculation
======================================================

#. Go to **Administration → Shipping & taxes → Shipping methods**.

#. Click on the shipping method you'd like to edit.

#. Enable the **Use for free shipping** setting. This will exclude the products with the enabled **Free shipping** setting from the shipping price calculation for this shipping method.

#. Save your changes.

   .. note::

        The shipping price for products without the **Free shipping** checkbox ticked will be calculated in accordance with **Shipping charges**.

================================
Way 2. Disable Shipping Entirely
================================

If you don’t want to assign a shipping method to orders at all, then :doc:`disable shipping entirely </user_guide/shipping_and_taxes/shipping_methods/disable_shipping>`.

==========================================
Way 3. Set Shipping Rates to Zero Manually
==========================================

You can create a shipping method with manual rate calculation and :doc:`set shipping rates to zero manually </user_guide/shipping_and_taxes/shipping_methods/manual_shipping_methods/set_free_shipping>`. It's also best to enable the **Use for free shipping** setting for this shipping method.
