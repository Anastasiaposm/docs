If an Error Occurs When Clicking the Recalculate Rates Button
*************************************************************

* Make sure that :doc:`the company and default customer addresses </user_guide/shipping_and_taxes/address>` are entered properly on the **Settings → Company** and **Settings → General** pages, and that they are different. The data on the **Test rate calculation** tab can be easily changed, but those changes will not affect the main addresses specified in the **Settings**.

  .. note::

      The **Default zip code** setting under **Settings → General** should have only one ZIP code, not a range. The same applies to the **Company ZIP code** setting under **Settings → Company**.
      
For realtime shipping methods:

* Make sure that the selected service in the **Shipping service** option ships from the company address to the default customer address.

* Make sure that the weight that was entered in the **Weight (lbs)** input field next to the **Recalculate rates** button can delivered by the service selected in the **Shipping service** drop-down list.
