************************************************
If an Error Occurs When Clicking the Test Button
************************************************

* The **Test** button works only for **real-time** shipping methods.

* Make sure that the company and default customer addresses are entered properly on the **Settings → Company** and **Settings → General** pages, and that they are different.

  .. note::

      The **Default zip code** setting under **Settings → General** should have only one ZIP code, not a range. The same applies to the **Company ZIP code** setting under **Settings → Company**.

* Make sure that the selected service in the **Shipping service** option ships from the company address to the default customer address.

* Make sure that the weight that was entered in the **Weight (lbs)** input field next to the **Test** button can delivered by the service selected in the **Shipping service** drop-down list.
