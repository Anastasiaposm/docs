How To: Disable Shipping on the Storefront
******************************************

Some stores don't require shipping at all. That's why you can hide shipping method selection on the checkout page.

#. Go to **Administration → Shipping & taxes → Shipping methods**.

#. Change the statuses of all shipping methods to *Disabled*.

   .. important::

       A product can have **Shipping freight** on the **Shipping properties** tab. But since the shipping method isn't selected now, the shipping freights of products won't be taken into account as well.

#. Go to **Design → Layouts** and switch to the **Checkout** tab.

#. Hide the block for shipping method selection. This will remove the mention of no shipping being required from the checkout page.
