How To: Set a Common Commentary for all Shipping Methods
********************************************************

In CS-Cart and Multi-Vendor, every shipping method has its own description. But if you want customers to see your shipping policy that's common for all shipping methods, you won't need to copy it into every description. There is a better way to do it: just add a block with text to the checkout page.

#. In the Administration panel, go to **Design â†’ Layouts** and switch to the **Checkout** tab.

#. :doc:`Create a new block </user_guide/look_and_feel/layouts/blocks/actions_on_blocks>` of the **HTML block** type.

#. Enter your shipping policy as the content of that block.

#. Move that block to the part of the checkout page where you want it to appear.
