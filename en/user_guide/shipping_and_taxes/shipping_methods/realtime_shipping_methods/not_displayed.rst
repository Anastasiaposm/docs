Why the Real Time Shipping Method is Not Displayed
**************************************************

If the real time shipping method is not displayed:

#. Go to **Administration → Shipping & taxes → Shipping methods** and click on the name of the shipping method.

#. Check whether the suitable carrier is selected in the **Carrier** field.

#. Check whether the suitable shipping service is chosen in the **Shipping service** fild.

#. Check whether the information is set up properly in the **Configure** tab.

   .. note::

       Make sure that the **Test** mode check box is not selected. Real time shipping services allow to execute only some special requests when the test mode is enabled.

#. Make sure that the products that are to be shipped have a weight specified, and the weight is more than 0. This is done on the :doc:`product editing pages </user_guide/manage_products/products/add_product>`.

#. If you set up a **USPS** shipping method, check that the user ID is confirmed. Call 800-344-7779 to confirm your ID.

#. In **Multi-Vendor** check whether vendors' addresses are correct. An incorrect vendor's address prevents shipping methods from displaying on a storefront.
