To do that:

#. Go to **Design â†’ Layouts**.

#. Select the :doc:`layout page </user_guide/look_and_feel/layouts/layout_pages/index>` and the place for the block.

#. :doc:`Add a new block </user_guide/look_and_feel/layouts/blocks/actions_on_blocks>` of the **Template** type with the *Shipping estimation* template.

#. Place that block anywhere you want.
