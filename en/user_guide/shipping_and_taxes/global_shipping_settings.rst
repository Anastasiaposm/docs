How To: Hide Shipping Options (Step 3 at Checkout)
**************************************************

You can disable the selection of the shipping method at checkout. To do it:

#. Go to **Settings → Checkout**.

#. Untick the **Display "Shipping Method" step** checkbox.

#. Click the **Save** button. Now customers won't have to select the shipping method at checkout, and the first active shipping method on the list will be used by default.
