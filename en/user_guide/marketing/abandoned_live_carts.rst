About Abandoned Carts
=====================

The **Orders â†’ Abandoned / Live carts** section contains the lists of products that your store visitors added to their carts and wishlists but didn't purchase for some reason. When registered customers leave the website and return later, the products that were in their carts will be readded to their carts automatically.

Even if a customer isn't registered, the data of a cart will be saved to the **Abandoned / Live carts** page.

.. note::

    Each storefront tracks visitors' carts separately.
