Abandoned / Live carts
**********************

The **Marketing â†’ Abandoned / Live carts** section contains the lists of products that your store visitors added to their carts and wishlists but didn't purchase for some reason. For registered customers, the products from the list are automatically added to their carts when they visit your store again.

.. note::

    Each storefront tracks visitors' carts separately.

======================
Unregistered Customers
======================

Even if a customer isn't registered, the data of a cart is saved. In that case the customer is listed as **Unregistered customer**.

.. important::

    Starting with CS-Cart 4.5.1, the name and email of an unregistered customer will be saved as well, if that customer enters them at checkout and proceeds to the next step.
