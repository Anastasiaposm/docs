Licensing Mode
**************

In this section you can choose one of three licensing modes: *Full*, *Trial*, or *Free*.

.. important::

    The *Free Mode* is not available in Multi-Vendor. It was also removed from CS-Cart starting with version 4.3.7.

In the **Full Mode** you get unrestricted access to the full functionality of CS-Cart or Multi-Vendor. To enable this mode you must enter the licence number.

You get the license number when you buy CS-Cart or Multi-Vendor `at the official website <https://www.cs-cart.com/compare.html>`_. You can switch to the **Full Mode** any time by entering a valid license number on the **Licensing mode** page.

The **Trial mode** has no functionality limitations. You can download `CS-Cart <https://www.cs-cart.com/download-cs-cart.html>`_ and `Multi-Vendor <https://www.cs-cart.com/download-multivendor.html>`_ from the official site and use the Trial Mode for free. However, you can use it only once and only for 30 days.

The **Free Mode** will be activated automatically in 30 days, unless you activate the **Full Mode**.

.. note::

    If you use CS-Cart 4.3.7 or higher, or Multi-Vendor, you'll be offered to enter the license number instead.

The **Free mode** allows you to run the store free of charge with no time restrictions. This mode offers a basic set of eCommerce tools. The **Free mode** is essentially a free version of CS-Cart, with some functionality and add-ons unavailable. You will be able to switch to the **Full mode** any time by entering a valid license number on the **Licensing mode** page.
