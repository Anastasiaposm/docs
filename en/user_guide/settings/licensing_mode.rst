Licensing Mode
**************

In this section you can choose one of the two licensing modes: *Full* or *Trial*.

In the **Full mode** you get unrestricted access to the full functionality of CS-Cart or Multi-Vendor. To enable this mode you must enter the license number.

You get the license number when you buy CS-Cart or Multi-Vendor `at the official website <https://www.cs-cart.com/compare.html>`_. You can switch to the full mode any time by entering a valid license number on the **Licensing mode** page.

The **Trial mode** also has no functionality limitations. You can download `CS-Cart <https://www.cs-cart.com/download-cs-cart.html>`_ and `Multi-Vendor <https://www.cs-cart.com/download-multivendor.html>`_ from the official site and use the trial mode for free. However, you can use it only once and only for 30 days. After that you'll be offered to enter the license number when you try to open the Administration panel.
