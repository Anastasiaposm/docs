.. important::
    This section of the settings is not available in **Multi-Vendor**, but only in **CS-Cart**.

Use these settings to adjust the configuration of the multiple-storefront feature of your CS-Cart installation.

* **Share users among stores**—if you enable this setting, the store will use a joint customer database where customer accounts are shared among all stores. Otherwise, each store has a separate customer base.

* **Default state of the "Update for all stores" icon**—determines if store-specific options are available for immediate editing in the root administrator mode. If you you set it to *Active*, you'll be able to edit store-specific options immediately. If you set it to *Not Active*, options are protected from unintended editing.

.. warning::
    Editing a store-specific option in the root administrator mode will update (overwrite) this option in all stores. We recommended that you keep store-specific options protected by setting **Default state of the "Update for all stores" icon** to *Not Active* to prevent unintended editing.
