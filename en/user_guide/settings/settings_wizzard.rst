Settings Wizard
***************

Settings wizard is a convenient post-installation tool. It allows you to set up some general preferences of your store in several steps.

.. note::
    When working with multiple stores in CS-Cart, use the **three people icon** to apply changes for all stores.

=================
Security settings
=================

* **New administrator password**—we recommend to change the administrator password that you got after the registration. Make sure your new password is secure enough.

You can generate the password automatically with the **Generate** button.

* **SSL certificate**—click the  **Check SSL** button to check the secure connection.

* **Enable secure connection at checkout**—if you enable this setting, checkout pages will work through the HTTPS protocol. This requires an SSL certificate to be installed on your server.

* **Enable secure connection in the administration panel**—if you enable this setting, the administration panel will work through the HTTPS protocol. This requires an SSL certificate to be installed on your server.

* **Enable secure connection for authentication, profile and orders pages**—if you enable this setting, the login and profile registration/update pages in the customer area will work through the HTTPS protocol. This requires an SSL certificate to be installed on your server.

* **Minimum administrator password length**—the minimum number of characters in an administrator password.

* **Administrator password must contain both letters and numbers**—if you enable this setting, the system will require an administrator password to contain both letters and numbers. This improves password strength and provides additional protection against guessing the password and brute-force attacks.

* **Force administrators to change password on the first login**—if selected, store administrators will have to change their passwords once they log in to the administration panel for the first time.

===================
Appearance Settings
===================

* **Default WYSIWYG editor**—the WYSIWYG editor to be used in the administrator panel. You can select *TinyMCE*, *Redactor* or *CKEditor*, or you can choose to disable WYSIWYG.

* **Primary currency**—select the primary currency of your store.

* **Backend default language**—the default language of the administration panel.

* **Estimate taxes using default address on cart/checkout pages**—if you enable this setting, customers without their own address in the database will see the taxes calculated according to the default address.

* **Display prices with taxes on category/product pages if the method of calculating taxes is based on a unit's price**—if you enable this setting, product prices displayed on the product and category pages will include taxes.

* **Display prices with taxes on cart/checkout pages if the method of calculating taxes is based on a unit's price**—if you enable this setting, product prices displayed on the cart and checkout pages will include taxes.

* **Show number of available products**—if you enable this setting, the number of products available for customers will be displayed on the storefront.

* **Display mini thumbnail images as a gallery**—if you enable this setting, multiple product thumbnails will be displayed as a small gallery.

* **Use "Value changer" for the Quantity field**—if you enable this setting, the ordinary quantity field in the product list and on the product details page will be supplemented with a widget to increase/decrease the product quantity.

* **Display product details in tabs**—if you enable this setting, product details (description, features and so on) will be arranged in multiple tabs.

* **Date format**—choose the date display format both in the administration panel and in the customer area.
