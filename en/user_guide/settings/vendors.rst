.. important::

    **Vendors** are only available in **Multi-Vendor**.

Use this section to adjust vendor settings for the Administration panel and the storefront.

* **Display product vendor**—if you enable this setting, the name of the product vendor will appear next to the product description.

* **Allow users to apply for vendor account**—if you enable this setting, :doc:`customers will be able to send the root administrator a request to become a vendor </user_guide/users/vendors/allow_customers_to_apply_for_vendor_account>`.

* **Automatically create the administrator account for the new approved vendor**—if you enable this setting, the company administrator will be automatically created together with the company.

* **Vendors per page**—the number of vendors displayed on one page.

* **Applying vendors must agree to terms and conditions**—if you enable this setting, then the customers who are applying for a vendor account will need to accept the terms and conditions. This setting first appeared in Multi-Vendor 4.3.7.

.. note:: 

    Starting with Multi-Vendor 4.3.6, the settings below are part of the **Vendor commission** add-on.

* **Include shipping cost in vendor commission**—if you enable this setting, the cost of shipping the order is considered at vendor commission calculation.

* **Take payment surcharge from vendors**—if you enable this setting, vendors will get entrusted to pay payment surcharges (see :doc:`this article </user_guide/payment_methods/configure_payment>` for details).
