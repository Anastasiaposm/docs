Use this section to configure the appearance and functionality of the checkout page.

* **Disable anonymous checkout**—if you enable this setting, only registered customers will be allowed to place orders in your store.

* **Profile address section order**—choose which customer address should go first on the checkout page: billing address or shipping address.

* **Ask customers to agree with terms & conditions during checkout**—if you enable this setting, customers will have to accept the terms and conditions of your store at checkout.

* **Allow customers to pay order again if transaction was declined**—if you enable this setting, customers will be allowed to carry out the same transaction if it failed previously.

* **Configure "Sign in" step**—choose whether to display the *Returning customer* or *New customer* section first.

  .. note::

      You can also hide the **Sign in** step, if it doesn't have any required contact info fields, and anonymous checkout is allowed.

* **Default option for the "New customer" section at the "Sign in"**—choose the default radio button in the *New customer* section—*Register* or *Checkout as guest*.

* **Display "Payment method" step**—if you enable this setting, then the *Billing Options* section will appear at checkout, and customers will be able to choose the desired payment method.

* **Display "Shipping method" step**—if you enable this setting, then the *Shipping Options* section will appear at checkout, and customers will be able to choose the desired shipping method.

  .. note::

      The **Display "Shipping method" step** setting is available only in **CS-Cart**, not in **Multi-Vendor**.
