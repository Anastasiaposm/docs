In this section you can specify what kind of events must be registered in the system logs. The events that can be logged are split into multiple types:

* **Orders**—select to track and record events concerning orders.

* **Users**—select to track and record events related to user activity.

* **Products**—select to track and record events concerning products in the catalog.

* **Categories**—select to track and record events concerning product categories.

* **Database**—select to track and record events concerning the database of your store.

* **Requests**—select to track and record all HTTP and HTTPS requests.

* **General**—select to track and record general events.

  .. note::

      You can find the log files in the *var/log* directory of your store. Since log files can grow larger with time, we recommended that you clean the *var/log* directory from time to time. You can also view and clean up the logs under **Administration → Logs**.
