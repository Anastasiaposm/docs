In this section, you can specify what kind of events must be registered in the system logs. You can find the log files in the *var/log* directory of your store. Since log files can gradually grow larger, we recommended that you clean the *var/log* directory from time to time. You can also view and clean up the logs under **Administration → Logs**.
