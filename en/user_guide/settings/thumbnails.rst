Use this section to specify parameters and properties of automatic thumbnail creation. To learn more about how these settings work, please refer to :doc:`the article about changing sizes of images </user_guide/look_and_feel/changing_attributes/change_image_size>`.

* **Thumbnail format**—the format of a resized thumbnail. You can choose to keep the original format or convert it to GIF, JPEG, or PNG.

* **JPEG format quality**—the quality of resized JPEG images. 

  For example, *100%* is hard to distinguish from the uncompressed original, but the images occupy more disk space; *10%* means serious image degradation. We recommended that you use the quality of no less than *60%*. In most cases, the optimal quality level is *80%*.
