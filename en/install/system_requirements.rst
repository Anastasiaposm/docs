***************************
CS-Cart System Requirements
***************************

======================
Web Server Environment
======================

CS-Cart is developed to meet most server configurations, ranging from shared hosting accounts to dedicated servers. 

There are two core requirements for your host to run CS-Cart:

* `PHP <http://www.php.net/>`_ version 5.3.6, 5.4, 5.5, or 5.6. We recommend **PHP 5.6 for CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor 4.3.x**. 

.. note::

    PHP 7 is supported starting with CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor 4.3.6. 

* `MySQL <http://www.mysql.com/>`_ version 4.1 or higher (MySQLi or pdo_mysql should be supported).

We recommend a **Unix-like operating system** for your server, such as FreeBSD, Linux, or OS X. These systems are scalable, more secure, and offer better performance.

.. note::

    CS-Cart is compatible with almost every server that supports PHP and MySQL. However, we recommend **Apache** or **Nginx** as the most robust and stable servers for your web store.

=================================
Server Configuration Requirements
=================================

* **safe_mode** PHP directive should be disabled.

* **file_uploads, allow_url_fopen** PHP directives should be enabled.

* **magic_quotes_gpc, magic_quotes_runtime, magic_quotes_sybase** PHP directives should be disabled in PHP 5.3 (ignore this if you have PHP 5.4 or higher).

* The following PHP commands should be **enabled**:

  .. list-table::
    :widths: 10 10 10 10 10

    *   -   ``ini_set`` 
        -   ``ftp_exec``
        -   ``ftp_connect``
        -   ``ftp_login``
        -   ``ftp_get``
    *   -   ``ftp_put``
        -   ``ftp_nb_fput``
        -   ``ftp_raw``
        -   ``ftp_rawlist``
        -   ``mysql_pconnect``
    *   -   ``eva``
        -   ``system``
        -   ``exec``
        -   ``shell_exec``
        -   ``passthru``
    *   -   ``escapeshellarg``
        -   ``set_time_limit``
        -
        -
        -   

* Either **GD** or **Imagick** PHP extension must be installed. These extensions are used for image manipulation, such as creating thumbnails, applying watermarks, etc. We recommend **Imagick**, because it offers much better quality of the processed images.

  * **GD** is included in PHP, however PHP should be compiled with the ``--with-gd`` flag. For detailed installation instructions please refer to the `official PHP documentation <http://php.net/manual/en/image.installation.php>`_. 

    .. note::

        Please make sure your GD configuration includes the **FreeType** font library.

  * **Imagick** is a `PECL extension <https://pecl.php.net/package/imagick>`_. Please check the `official documentation <http://php.net/manual/en/imagick.setup.php>`_ for installation instructions. `ImageMagick <http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php>`_ version 6.5.3-10+ and PHP 5.4.0+ must be installed on your server.

    .. important::

        We strongly recommend using at least **ImageMagick 6.9.3-10** or higher, as it includes a critical vulnerability fix. **ImageMagick 7 is not supported yet**.

* **cURL support** should be enabled. You need this PHP extension to ensure support of secure connections, some payment systems such as PayPal and Authorize.Net, and real-time shipping rate calculators for FedEx and DHL/Airborne.

* **Phar extension** should be enabled (built into PHP since v5.3.0).

* **ZipArchive extension** should be enabled (built into PHP since v5.2.0).

* **.htaccess** file (if supported) should have the following directives **allowed**: 

  .. list-table::
    :widths: 10 10 10 10 10

    *   -   ``DirectoryIndex``
        -   ``Deny``
        -   ``Allow``
        -   ``Options``
        -   ``Order``
    *   -   ``AddHandler``
        -   ``RewriteEngine``
        -   ``RewriteBase``
        -   ``RewriteCond``
        -   ``RewriteRule``

* If PHP was compiled with the `Suhosin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suhosin>`_ extension, then configure it in the **php.ini** file as follows::

    suhosin.memory_limit = 0
    suhosin.post.max_vars = 3000
    suhosin.get.max_totalname_length = 3000
    suhosin.session.encrypt = Off
    suhosin.session.cryptua = Off
    suhosin.cookie.cryptdocroot = Off
    suhosin.session.cryptdocroot = Off

  .. note::

      Suhosin is a PHP extension intended for protection. However, it can cause :doc:`various issues <possible_issues/suhosin>` with CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor.

=======================================
CS-Cart Architects Team Recommends This
=======================================

* Use a **virtual** or **dedicated** private server instead of a shared hosting; this allows for smoother upgrades.
 
* Install and enable **Openssl** PHP extension to generate more secure session keys.

* Install **Redis** or **APCu** and set it as a CS-Cart cache backend.

* Install **OPcache**.

* Install the **mod_deflate** Apache mod.

============================
Compatible Hosting Providers
============================

As you can see, the requirements for the web server environment are quite typical. Thousands of hosting providers meet them. But if you canâ€™t decide on the hosting for your web store, please consider a compatible hosting provider from our `Compatible Hosting <http://www.cs-cart.com/compatible-hosting.html>`_ list.
