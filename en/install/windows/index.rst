Installing CS-Cart on Windows on XAMPP
**************************************

If you'd like to test CS-Cart, but you don't have a suitable server, you can install CS-Cart on Windows.

All you need to do is install XAMPP (a popular PHP development environment that includes PHP, Apache, and MySQL), then install CS-Cart on XAMPP. You can use other PHP development envioronments, but the principle is the same.

.. important::

    Please note that `we recommend a Unix-like operating system </install/system_requirements>`_ for the server of your live store. `XAMPP isn't recommended </developer_guide/getting_started/configuring_environment>`_ as a development or production environment for your store.
