About Comments to CS-Cart Documentation
***************************************

Hello, and welcome to CS-Cart documentation! We hope that you find what you’re looking for. As you noticed, you can leave comments to any article. This is made possible via `Disqus <https://disqus.com>`_, a third-party commenting platform.

=============
General Rules
=============

#. Don’t post inappropriate messages (such as advertising, swearing, insulting, distribution of different forms of illegal content, and so on).

#. Be polite and respectful to each other.

=========================
How We Work with Comments
=========================

Comments are regularly checked by our tech writers (the people who maintain CS-Cart documentation, among other things). We try to help regardless of what questions you ask, but **we don’t have any timeframes for answering documentation comments**. Even if there is no reply yet, we’ve probably seen your message, taken it into account, and will try to reply when we can. 

With that in mind, below you’ll find information on how to make the best use of the documentation comments, along with other channels of communication.

--------------------------
What Comments Are Good For
--------------------------

#. **For pointing out issues with documentation.** We strive to keep our documentation error-free and up to date, but sometimes mistakes can slip through. If you found an error, you’re welcome to leave a comment, and we will look into it.

#. **For clarifying vague parts about certain articles.** If you consider an article to be lacking in information, feel free to bring it up as well. We’ll try our best to reply and will see how we can address your question in documentation in the future.

--------------------------------------
What Comments Aren’t Good for, and Why
--------------------------------------

#. **For seeking guaranteed and timely answers.** Although we try our best to reply to comments here in a reasonable amount of time, it isn’t always possible. That’s why we have other channels:

   * `Help Desk <https://helpdesk.cs-cart.com/>`_ or `our contact form <https://www.cs-cart.com/send-message.html>`_. It is the fastest and surest way to get an answer from us (the company behind CS-Cart and Multi-Vendor). 

   * Our forums at `http://forum.cs-cart.com/ <http://forum.cs-cart.com/>`_. It’s a place where members of CS-Cart community help each other with advice. There are many people on the forum, including those with experience in custom development and server configuration.

#. **For reporting bugs.** We have `a separate bug tracker <http://forum.cs-cart.com/tracker/project-1-cs-cart/>`_ for that purpose. It has more visibility, and it offers tools for tracking bug history. For more information why that’s important, please refer to `our bug fixing policy <https://www.cs-cart.com/bug-fixing.html>`_.

#. **For technical support and investigating problems in clients’ stores.** If a problem occurs in your store, it’s best to contact our technical support via `Help Desk <https://helpdesk.cs-cart.com/>`_. If necessary, our support specialists will request access credentials from you to investigate the problem in your own store. Here’s `our support policy <https://www.cs-cart.com/support-service.html>`_.

#. **For technical questions that aren’t covered by our articles (such as coding or changing the standard functionality of CS-Cart or Multi-Vendor).** These questions are beyond the scope of our technical support, and by extension, beyond the scope of documentation comments. However, you’re welcome to ask them on our forums at `http://forum.cs-cart.com/ <http://forum.cs-cart.com/>`_.
