Functionality Changes
=====================

[*] Abandoned carts: The interface was improved.

[*] Add-ons: Advanced Products Import: Execution timeout was added for loading remote images; it prevents situations when it's taking too long for the image to load.

[*] Add-ons: Advanced Products Import: The maximum number of features available on the "Fields mapping" tab is no longer limited to 150.

[*] Add-ons: Blog: The list of posts is now split into pages. If you had multiple parent pages for blog posts, switch between those pages with the search mechanism in the right sidebar.

[*] Add-ons: HiDPI displays support: Multiple technical improvements were made. The add-on now uses the srcset attribute instead of JavaScript logic.

[*] Add-ons: Image Zoom: Deprecated image zooming library was replaced.

[*] Add-ons: Old Admin Panel: The add-on no longer comes with CS-Cart & Multi-Vendor by default. Existing installations will still have it after the upgrade.

[*] Add-ons: Social buttons: The default code for Yandex.Share buttons was updated.

[*] Add-ons: Social login: The third-party library used in the add-on was updated to the latest version.

[*] Add-ons: Store Locator: The add-on was renamed to "Stores and pickup points" to reflect that it now allows creating a “Pick up from store” shipping method. All map-related settings were removed from the add-on, because maps are now handled by “Maps and geolocation”.

[*] Multi-Vendor Plus: Add-ons: Direct customer-to-vendor payments (Beta): Add-on updated to work properly with the new single-page checkout.

[*] Multi-Vendor: Add-ons: Comments and reviews: The button for leaving a review on a vendor's page now works the same way as the button on the product page—customers always see it, but may need to sign in to leave a review.
