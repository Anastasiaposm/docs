[+] Multi-Vendor: Design: Layouts: Vendors can now manage blocks on the "Products", "Pages", "Micro-store", and "Vendors" layout pages; they can also adjust those layout pages for a specific product or page.

Bugfixes
========

[!] Add-ons: Anti Fraud: The add-on didn't work with newly-registered MaxMind accounts. Fixed; the integration with the minFraud service was updated.

[!] Add-ons: Bestsellers & On-Sale Products: Advanced search: Entering any value in the "Sales amount" field resulted in an error, and the search didn't work. Fixed.

[!] Add-ons: Call requests: An order wasn't placed when the "Buy now with 1 click" button was used in the "Hot deals" block. Fixed.

[!] Add-ons: Comments and reviews: A product's rating could be different on the category page and on the product page, because it was rounded differently. Fixed.

[!] Add-ons: E-mail marketing: Administrator privileges didn't work: any administrator could always view and edit the list of subscribers. Fixed.

[!] Add-ons: Email marketing: REST API: Creating a subscriber via REST API didn't work because company_id was set to 0. Fixed.

[!] Add-ons: Google reCAPTCHA: The add-on didn't work on some web hostings because the file_get_contents function returned "false". As a result, customers were asked to pass the CAPTCHA again. Fixed.

[!] Add-ons: PayPal payments: Shipping cost was saved incorrectly after IPN processing. Fixed.

[!] Add-ons: SEO: HTML tags were not removed from rich snippets. Fixed.

[!] Add-ons: SEO: Store Locator: The "Store locator" page (index.php?dispatch=store_locator.search) didn't have a canonical URL. Fixed.

[!] Add-ons: Store locator: The Google map didn't load on the store location editing page when HTTPS was enabled for the administration panel. Fixed.

[!] Add-ons: Suppliers: The list of suppliers in the Administration panel displayed the current date and time rather than the date and time when a supplier was registered. Fixed.

Fixed; now administrators are notified when a thumbnail can't be created.

[!] CS-Cart: Stores: The progress bar did not work during storefront creation. Fixed.

[!] Catalog: A fatal error occurred on PHP 7.1 when a customer viewed a product that had forbidden option combinations. Fixed.

[!] Checkout as guest: Profile fields: When a custom profile field was created in "Contact information" and was required to be filled in at checkout, the guest had to enter an email address. That email address wasn't validated: anything could be entered in that field. Fixed.

[!] Design: Storefront: Cart pop-up: When a product with 7 or more options was added to cart, the cart pop-up was displayed incorrectly on mobile devices. Fixed.

[!] Design: Themes: Bright theme: The "Enable quick view" setting didn't affect whether the Quick View button would appear for products in a Products block with the Scroller template. Fixed.

[!] Languages: Export: When more than 10,000 values of the language variables were exported at the same time, some of the values in the exported file were replaced with the duplicates of other random values. Fixed.

[!] Multi-Vendor: Add-ons: PayPal Adaptive Payments: Some vendors were unable to pass PayPal verification. Fixed; now if a vendor can't pass verification, it means that the vendor must specify PayPal account holder's first name and last name in Multi-Vendor administration panel.

[!] Payment methods: ServiRed (Redsys): Payments were not processed properly when an order was placed from the Administration panel. Fixed.

[!] Payment methods: Skrill: Email and secret word verification links didn't work. Fixed; the email and secret word verification was removed, because the verification is no longer used.

[!] Products: Edit selected: If only the maximum or minimum order quantity were edited, and the values were applied to all selected products, a PHP notice was recorded to the log. Fixed.

[!] Products: Edit selected: When editing multiple products at once, the product price was displayed with more digits after decimal point that was needed. Fixed.

[!] Products: Quantity discounts: Product prices could appear with more figures after decimal point than specified in the currency settings, and those extra figures were always zeroes. Fixed.

[!] REST API: Orders: An order could be placed on behalf of a customer that didn't belong to the storefront, even when sharing of users between storefronts was disabled. Fixed.

[!] Shipping methods: DHL: When shipping rates were reported in non-primary currency, the cost of shipping was not converted properly. Fixed.

[!] Shipping methods: Temando: PHP errors could occur when shipping rates were obtained. Fixed.

[!] {#6766} Multi-Vendor: Vendor Plans: The email notification that informed the vendor about one-time payment for the plan had a piece of code next to the payment amount instead of  "one time". Fixed.

[!] {#6767} Design: Email templates: The import of email templates didn't work. Fixed.
